In the present study, we tested whether the highly specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine, reduces dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by chronic treatment with low doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.
Weekly intramuscular 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine injections (0.2-0.5 mg/kg body weight), in combination with daily administration of 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine or vehicle, were performed until the development of parkinsonian motor symptoms in either of the two experimental groups (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine versus 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle).
After 21 weeks of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment, all 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals displayed parkinsonian symptoms, whereas none of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys were significantly affected.
These behavioural observations were consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging data, and with post-mortem stereological counts of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, as well as striatal intensity measurements of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, which were all significantly higher in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated animals than in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated monkeys.
The 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine treatment also had a significant effect on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced loss of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus and adjoining A5 and A7 noradrenaline cell groups.
In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals, almost 40% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neurons was found in locus coeruleus/A5/A7 noradrenaline cell groups, whereas the extent of neuronal loss was lower than 15% of control values in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys.
Our data demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine, significantly reduces 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups in non-human primates.
Effect of ketoconazole-mediated CYP3A4 inhibition on clinical pharmacokinetics of panobinostat (LBH589), an orally active histone deacetylase inhibitor.
This study evaluated the effect of a potent CYP3A inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the pharmacokinetics and safety of panobinostat.
On day 8, a single panobinostat dose was co-administered with ketoconazole.
In the presence of ketoconazole, there was 1.6- and 1.8-fold increase in C (max) and AUC of panobinostat, respectively.
Co-administration of panobinostat with CYP3A inhibitors is feasible as the observed increase in panobinostat PK parameters was not considered clinically relevant.
Considering the variability in exposure following enzyme inhibition and the fact that chronic dosing of panobinostat was not studied with CYP3A inhibitors, close monitoring of panobinostat-related adverse events is necessary.
Interaction study of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin with co-administered drugs.
Moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin are fluoroquinolone antibiotics used in treating urinary and respiratory tract infections.
Being moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin fluoroquinolones the interaction study of was carried out with sucralfate, gelusil, erythromycin and multi minerals.
The response of moxifloxacin and lomefloxacin after interaction with co-administered drugs at different conditions and temperature were noted using a Shimadzu HPLC system with PDA detector.
Moxifloxacin and Lomefloxacin reacts faster with sucralfate and gelusil in acidic media whereas with erythromycin in basic media and multi-minerals in neutral media.
Exposure to oral S-ketamine is unaffected by itraconazole but greatly increased by ticlopidine.
This study examined drug-drug interactions of oral S-ketamine with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine and the CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole.
In this randomized, blinded, crossover study, 11 healthy volunteers ingested 0.2 mg/kg S-ketamine after pretreatments with oral ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily), itraconazole (200 mg once daily), or placebo in 6-day treatment periods at intervals of 4 weeks.
Ticlopidine treatment increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-   )) of oral ketamine by 2.4-fold, whereas itraconazole treatment did not increase the exposure to S-ketamine.
The ratio of norketamine AUC(0-   ) to ketamine AUC(0-   ) was significantly decreased in the ticlopidine (P &lt; 0.001) and itraconazole phases (P = 0.006) as compared to placebo.
In the ticlopidine and itraconazole phases, the areas under the effect-time curves (self-reported drowsiness and performance) were significantly higher than those in the placebo phase (P < 0.05).
The findings suggest that the dosage of S-ketamine should be reduced in patients receiving ticlopidine.
The 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), one of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase inhibitors, has shown antitumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia.
We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells.
In addition, DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2, and the combination of ABT-737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis.
Implanon   failure in an HIV-positive woman on antiretroviral therapy resulting in two ectopic pregnancies.
We present an interesting case of an HIV-positive woman on antiretroviral therapy having tubal pregnancies on two separate occasions with Implanon in place.
Antidepressant-warfarin interaction and associated gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study.
We sought to evaluate whether initiation of an antidepressant increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in warfarin users.
In total, 430,455 warfarin users contributed 407,370 person-years of warfarin use.
Warfarin users had an increased odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of citalopram (OR   =   1.73 [95% CI, 1.25-2.38]), fluoxetine (OR   =   1.63 [95% CI, 1.11-2.38]), paroxetine (OR   =   1.64 [95% CI, 1.27-2.12]), amitriptyline (OR   =   1.47 [95% CI, 1.02-2.11]).
Also mirtazapine, which is not believed to interact with warfarin, increased the risk of GI bleeding (OR   =   1.75 [95% CI, 1.30-2.35]).
Warfarin users who initiated citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or mirtazapine had an increased risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding.
The incubations were performed in the absence and presence of the non-specific CYP inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) and isoform-specific inhibitors.
ABT decreased the toxicity of precocene I, increased exposure to parent compound, and decreased metabolite levels in a dose-dependent manner.
Of the isoform-specific CYP inhibitors tested for an effect on the precocene I metabolite profile, only tranylcypromine was noticeably effective, indicating a role of CYPs 2A6, 2C9, 2Cl9, and 2E1.
With respect to toxicity, the order of CYP inhibitor effectiveness was ABT>diethyldithiocarbamate~tranylcypromine>ketoconazole.
Furafylline and sulfaphenazole had no effect, while quinidine appeared to augment precocene I toxicity.
These results suggest that rat liver slices do not reproduce the reported in vivo biotransformation of precocene I and therefore may not be an appropriate model for precocene I metabolism.
To determine whether the co-injection of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes improves retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2).
AAV2 containing cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the control of a chicken   -actin promoter, was delivered by intravitreal injection to adult mice in conjunction with enzymes including collagenase, hyaluronan lyase, heparinase III, or chondroitin ABC lyase.
The addition of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase greatly enhanced transduction of the retinal ganglion cell layer and increased the depth of transduction into the outer retina.
Hyaluronan lyase had a limited effect and collagenase was ineffective.
Electroretinograms survived with higher concentrations of heparinase III and chondroitin ABC lyase than were required for optimal retinal transduction.
AAV2-mediated retinal transduction is improved by co-injection of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase.
Prevention of emergence agitation in seven children receiving low-dose ketamine and propofol total intravenous anesthesia.
We retrospectively reviewed the records of 7 pediatric oncology patients who received low-dose ketamine in conjunction with propofol for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) repeatedly for radiation therapy.
EA signs were observed in all 7 patients in association with propofol TIVA but did not recur in any of 123 subsequent anesthetics sessions during which low-dose ketamine was added to propofol.
Based on this experience, we suggest that low-dose ketamine added to propofol may be associated with prevention of EA in children with a history of EA with propofol TIVA.
Tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, is the standard hormone treatment for breast cancer.
Paroxetine and fluoxetine reduce the plasma concentration of endoxifen by about 50%.
It is better to avoid prescribing isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors to women treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer, especially SSRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and fluoxetine.
Depression does not always require antidepressant drug therapy, and antidepressants have no proven preventive impact on hot flushes linked to the menopause.
If in certain cases, an antidepressant is considered necessary, it may be advisable to replace tamoxifen with anastrozole.
Amphetamine locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference in adolescent male and female rats neonatally treated with quinpirole.
The objective was to analyze the effects of neonatal quinpirole treatment on effects of amphetamine in adolescent rats using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference procedures.
In female rats, neonatal quinpirole treatment enhanced amphetamine locomotor sensitization compared with quinpirole-free controls sensitized to amphetamine.
Male rats demonstrated sensitization to amphetamine, although this was muted compared with female rats, and were unaffected by neonatal quinpirole.
Rats treated with neonatal quinpirole enhanced time spent in the amphetamine-paired context compared with quinpirole-free controls conditioned with amphetamine, but only female controls conditioned with amphetamine spent more time in the drug-paired context compared with saline-treated controls.
In vivo CYP3A activity is significantly lower in cyclosporine-treated as compared with tacrolimus-treated renal allograft recipients.
In vitro studies have identified cyclosporine and tacrolimus as CYP3A inhibitors.
Systemic and apparent oral midazolam clearance were 24% (269    73 vs. 354    102  ml/min, P = 0.022) and 31% (479    190 vs. 688    265  ml/min, P = 0.013), respectively, lower in cyclosporine-treated patients (n = 20) than in matched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 20).
The latter displayed midazolam clearances similar to those in two larger cohorts of nonmatched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 58 and n = 80) and to those receiving a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen (n = 6).
This implies that in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities are significantly lower in patients receiving cyclosporine than in those receiving tacrolimus, indicating that, at the doses generally used in clinical practice, cyclosporine is the stronger of the two with respect to CYP3A inhibition.
Improved parathyroid hormone control by cinacalcet is associated with reduction in darbepoetin requirement in patients with end-stage renal disease.
Uncontrolled hy-per-parathyroidism causes bone marrow fibrosis, leading to erythropoietin (EPO) resistance.
Medical treatment with cinacalcet is effective in reducing plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, but its effect on darbepoetin dosing is unknown.
The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the difference in darbepoetin responsiveness before and after 12 months of cinacalcet therapy.
Reduction of PTH by cinacalcet is associated with a decrease in darbepoetin requirement.
Interaction of celecoxib with different anti-cancer drugs is antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cells.
This study investigates the ability of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors to sensitize cells from different origins to several chemotherapeutic agents.
The sensitivity, cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA damage of five different cancer cell lines (HeLa, HCT116, HepG2, MCF7 and U251) to 5-FU, cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide   celecoxib following different incubation schedules were analyzed.
We found antagonism between celecoxib and the four drugs in the breast cancer cells MCF7 following all incubation schedules and between celecoxib and doxorubicin in all cell lines except for two combinations in HCT116 cells.
These results, if confirmed in-vivo, indicate that celecoxib is not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with doxorubicin for other cancers.
[Interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors].
The drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel has been the subject of much study in recent years.
Contradictory results regarding the effect of proton pump inhibitors on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in clopidogrel-treated patients have been reported in literature.
Concomitant use of omeprazole and clopidogrel was found to decrease the exposure (AUC) to clopidogrel's active metabolite by 50% and to sharply increase platelet reactivity, as a result of inhibition by omeprazole of CYP2C19, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme.
Pantoprazole has a much weaker effect on clopidogrel's pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use.
The influence of the other proton pump inhibitors when used simultaneously with clopidogrel has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies.
Regulatory agencies state that the combination of clopidogrel and the CYP2C19 inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole should be avoided.
To date, there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically-relevant interaction between any of the proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel.
In vitro activity of minocycline combined with fosfomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of minocycline combined with fosfomycin against isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
The susceptibility results for minocycline and fosfomycin were interpreted according to the most relevant criteria.
The combination of minocycline and fosfomycin can be synergistic against MRSA.
The authors report the case of an infant with confirmed congenital hypothyroidism on levothyroxine who experienced a possible drug interaction with simeticone.
Questioning revealed the child was taking Infacol drops before feeds while on levothyroxine.
Drug interaction of thyroxine with simeticone has not been reported previously and is not listed in the British National Formulary for Children.
Calcium does not inhibit the absorption of 5 milligrams of nonheme or heme iron at doses less than 800 milligrams in nonpregnant women.
Calcium is the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both nonheme and heme iron.
However, the evidence for a calcium effect on iron absorption mainly comes from studies that did not isolate the effect of calcium from that of other dietary components, because it was detected in single-meal studies.
Our objective was to establish potential effects of calcium on absorption of nonheme and heme iron and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal.
We evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg nonheme iron (as ferrous sulfate).
We also evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg heme iron [as concentrated RBC (CRBC)].
Calcium was administered as calcium chloride in all studies and minerals were ingested on an empty stomach.
Calcium doses   1000 mg diminished nonheme iron absorption by an average of 49.6%.
A calcium dose of 800 mg diminished absorption of 5 mg heme iron by 37.7%.
In conclusion, we demonstrated an isolated effect of calcium (as chloride) on absorption of 5 mg of iron provided as nonheme (as sulfate) and heme (as CRBC) iron.
Synergistic interaction between sunitinib and docetaxel is sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with EGFR TKIs-resistant mutation.
This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of sunitinib and that of concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib and docetaxel in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs.
NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M mutation and K-ras mutation were exposed to either sunitinib or docetaxel or both based on various sequential administrations.
Sunitinib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in NSCLC cell lines and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, whereas docetaxel arrested at S phase.
Although single or concurrent use of sunitinib and docetaxel has some anti-proliferative effects, the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti-tumor activity.
When cells were exposed to docetaxel followed by sunitinib, synergism was observed.
The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by docetaxel exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to sunitinib.
Sunitinib as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K-ras mutations but the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by sunitinib is superior to sunitinib followed by docetaxel and concurrent administration.
Distinct synergistic action of piperacillin and methylglyoxal against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Results revealed that the strains were resistant to many drugs at high levels, only piperacillin, carbenicillin, amikacin and ciprofloxacin showed resistances at comparatively lower levels.
Distinct and statistically significant synergism was observed between methylglyoxal and piperacillin by disc diffusion tests when compared with their individual effects.
Synergism was also noted when methylglyoxal was combined with carbenicillin and amikacin.
Protective effect of acetyl-l-carnitine and  alpha lipoic acid against the acute toxicity of diepoxybutane to human lymphocytes.
(ii) acetyl-l-carnitine elicits a significant protective effect on DEB induced toxicity, which was potentiated by  alpha-lipoic acid.
[Influence of hemantane and doxycycline on MPTP-evoked behavior violations in C57BL/6 mice].
The effects of anti-parkinsonian drug hemantane [(2-adamantyl)hexamethylenimine] (10 mg/kg, p. o.)
and/or antibiotic drug doxycycline (100 mg/kg, p. o.), as well as that of neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (4 x 20 mg/kg, i. p.)
Acute administration of hemantane or doxycycline failed to influence locomotion in mice, while their combination normalized motor activity.
The role of p27(Kip1) in dasatinib-enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells.
The effect of dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, on paclitaxel sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts.
The roles of p27(Kip1), Bcl-2, and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, siRNA knockdown of gene expression, transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors, and flow cytometry.
HEY cells treated with dasatinib plus paclitaxel formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone.
Treatment of HEY xenograft-bearing mice with dasatinib plus paclitaxel inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone (average tumor volume per mouse, dasatinib + paclitaxel vs paclitaxel: 0.28 vs. 0.81 cm3, difference = 0.53 cm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44 to 0.62 cm3, P = .014);
dasatinib + paclitaxel vs.
The siRNA knockdown of p27(Kip1) decreased dasatinib- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA (sub-G1 fraction, control siRNA vs. p27(Kip1) siRNA: 42.5% vs. 20.1%, difference = 22.4%, 95% CI = 20.1% to 24.7%, P = .017).
Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that dasatinib-mediated induction of p27(Kip1) enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression.
Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or dasatinib enhances paclitaxel sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27(Kip1)-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression.
Phase I trial of lenalidomide and CCI-779 in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma: evidence for lenalidomide-CCI-779 interaction via P-glycoprotein.
The preclinical combination of lenalidomide with the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 has displayed synergy in vitro and represents a novel combination in MM.
Enhancement of humoral immune responses to inactivated Newcastle disease and avian influenza vaccines by oral administration of ginseng stem-and-leaf saponins in chickens.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of ginseng stem-and-leaf saponins (GSLS) on the humoral immune responses of chickens to inactivated ND and AI vaccines.
In experiment 1, oral administration of GSLS at a dose of 5 mg/kg of BW for 7 d on the immune response in chickens intramuscularly injected with inactivated ND vaccine was evaluated.
In experiment 2, the same regimen of GSLS was administered to chickens inoculated with inactivated AI vaccines, and an enhanced serum antibody response to AI vaccination was also observed.
Considering the safety of GSLS, because no adverse effect was found throughout the experiments, GSLS may be a promising oral adjuvant to improve immunization in poultry.
Interaction of dacarbazine and imexon, in vitro and in vivo, in human A375 melanoma cells.
We evaluated mechanisms of interaction between the alkyating agent dacarbazine (DTIC) and the pro-oxidant, imexon, in the human A375 melanoma cell line.
The effect of DTIC and imexon, alone and in combination, was evaluated for growth inhibition (MTT), radiolabeled drug uptake, cellular thiol content (HPLC), and DNA strand breaks (Comet assay).
There was a >75% reduction in cellular glutathione and cysteine with imexon but not DTIC.
Imexon and dacarbazine show additive effects in vitro but not in vivo in human A375 melanoma cells.
Lapatinib enhances herceptin-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by up-regulation of cell surface HER2 expression.
Although it was previously reported that lapatinib combined with Herceptin improved the progression-free survival rate compared with lapatinib alone for patients with Herceptin-refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the mechanism is purported to be an antiproliferative effect relating to the synergism of these two agents.
We evaluated how lapatinib interacts with Herceptin in HER2-positive breast cancer, with a particular focus on Herceptin-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
In an in vitro assay, lapatinib induced HER2 expression at the cell surface of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, leading to the enhancement of Herceptin-mediated ADCC.
Furthermore, we present a case report in which a second Herceptin treatment following lapatinib resulted in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer.
Lapatinib may have the potential to convert Herceptin-refractory to Herceptin-sensitive tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer by up-regulation of the cell surface expression of HER2.
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HB-EGF is a therapeutic target for T-ALL, and to further elucidate the antitumor effects of a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197).
We elucidated the expression of HB-EGF in T-ALL cell lines, and evaluated the effect of CRM197 on these cells alone or in combination with anticancer agent.
CRM197 induced apoptosis, and furthermore, the combination of CRM197 plus doxorubicin enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line.
Ephedrine enhances the antinociceptive effect of dexmedetomidine in mice.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug ephedrine has any effect on dexmedetomidine-induced antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mice in acute application.
saline + saline, ephedrine (10   mg/kg) + saline, saline + dexmedetomidine (15     g/kg) and ephedrine (10   mg/kg) + dexmedetomidine (15     g/kg), intraperitoneally, 30 min before hot plate or holed open field tests.
In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of 15     g/kg dexmedetomidine with 10   mg/kg ephedrine intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by dexmedetomidine.
At the same time, the locomotor inhibitory effect of dexmedetomidine was counteracted by ephedrine.
We concluded that the combined administration of dexmedetomidine with ephedrine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans.
[Efficacy of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan in hospitalized patients with hypertensive disease]
Efficacy and tolerability of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination was studied in 86 patients with hypertensive disease hospitalized in departments of general internal medicine or cardiology.
All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (n=43) or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary (n=43).
Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%).
But the use of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP, quicker achievement of target BP (5.8+/-2.3 and 9.2+/-1.8 days, respectively, 0.05), lesser number of antihypertensive drugs (2.5+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.9 days, respectively), lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment (12 and 31%, respectively, 0.05).
We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer antihypertensive drugs, and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment.
Ticagrelor (Brilinta)--better than clopidogrel (Plavix)
The FDA has approved ticagrelor (Brilinta-AstraZeneca), an oral antiplatelet drug, for use with low-dose aspirin to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
It will compete with clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Effient) for such use.
Influence of piperine on ibuprofen induced antinociception and its pharmacokinetics.
In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of ibuprofen evaluated by both acetic acid writhing and formalin test, when it was administered with ibuprofen.
Ibuprofen plasma concentration was also increased when it was administered with piperine.
The synergistic antinociception activity of ibuprofen when administered with piperine can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of ibuprofen.
From this study it can be concluded that piperine can be used as a bioenhancer along with ibuprofen.
Pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were not altered by the addition of either lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine.
No clinically significant changes to lamivudine or zidovudine pharmacokinetics were observed following concomitant administration of abacavir.
Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol.
Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure . The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.
In a study of 11 HIV-infected patients receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily) with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI 6% to 42%).
Cholestyramine: Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean AUC of total ezetimibe approximately 55%.
The incremental LDL-C reduction due to adding ezetimibe to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction.
Fibrates: The safety and effectiveness of ezetimibe administered with fibrates have not been established.
Co-administration of ZETIA with fibrates is not recommended until use in patients is studied.
Fenofibrate: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant fenofibrate administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.5-fold.
Gemfibrozil: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant gemfibrozil administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.7-fold.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were seen when ezetimibe was co-administered with atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin.
Cyclosporine: The total ezetimibe level increased 12-fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications, including cyclosporine.
Patients who take both ezetimibe and cyclosporine should be carefully monitored.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).
A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).
In oral (gavage) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).
In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe).
Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures.
When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
These are described in greater detail below:  Oral hypoglycemics, Coumarin-type anticoagulants, Phenytoin, Cyclosporine, Rifampin, Theophylline, Terfenadine, Cisapride, Astemizole, Rifabutin, Tacrolimus, Short-acting benzodiazepines,  Oral hypoglycemics: Clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitated by the use of DIFLUCAN with oral hypoglycemic agents;
one fatality has been reported from hypoglycemia in association with combined DIFLUCAN and glyburide use.
DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents.
When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary.
Coumarin-type anticoagulants: Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants.
In post-marketing experience, as with other azole antifungals, bleeding events (bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and melena) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin.
Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended.
Phenytoin: DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin.
Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended.
Cyclosporine: DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment.
Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine.
Rifampin: Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN.
Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin.
Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline.
Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended.
Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed.
Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.
The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.
The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.
Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.
A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval.
The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.
Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.
Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.
Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.
Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.
Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.
Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.
This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.
If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.
Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels;
however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels.
The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation.
While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism.
You cannot take mazindol if you have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or phenelzine (Nardil) in the last 14 days.
Changes in insulin and other diabetes drug therapies may be necessary during treatment with mazindol.
Mazindol may reduce the effects of guanethidine (Ismelin).
Before taking this medication, tell your doctor if you are taking a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline (Elavil), amoxapine (Asendin), doxepin (Sinequan), nortriptyline (Pamelor), imipramine (Tofranil), clomipramine (Anafranil), protriptyline (Vivactil), or desipramine (Norpramin).
Preliminary evidence suggests that cimetidine inhibits mebendazole metabolism and may result in an increase in plasma concentrations of mebendazole.
Patients receiving antibiotics and sulfonamides generally should not be treated with ganglion blockers.
The action of Mecamylamine may be potentiated by anesthesia, other antihypertensive drugs and alcohol.
Aminoglutethimide administered concomitantly with depo-subQ provera 104 may significantly decrease the serum concentrations of MPA.
Pharmacokinetic studies show that there are no significant alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine or rifabutin to warrant dosage adjustment when megestrol acetate is administered with these drugs.
A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that coadministration of megestrol acetate and indinavir results in a significant decrease in the pharmacokinetic parameters (~36% for Cmax and ~28% for AUC) of indinavir.
Administration of a higher dose of indinavir should be considered when coadministering with megestrol acetate.
The effects of indinavir, zidovudine or rifabutin on the pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate were not studied.
Melatonin may interact with the following drugs: aspirin and other NSAIDs (may lower melatonin levels), fluvoxamine (bioavailability of oral melatonin is increased with coadministration), beta blockers (may decrease melatonin levels), fluoxetine (reports of psychotic episodes when coadministered), progestin (coadministration of melatonin with progestin can inhibit ovarian function in women), benzodiazepenes and other sedating drugs (may result in additive sedation and an increased incidence of adverse effects), and corticosteroids (coadministration of melatonin and corticosteroids may interfere with the efficacy of the corticosteroids).
ACE inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.
Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam.
however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.
Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone.
MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.
Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%.
Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam.
Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses.
In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam.
Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients.
Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect.
Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam.
Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.
Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.
Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn.
Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly.
Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate.
In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites.
Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding.
The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8.
In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time.
Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced.
DRUG INTERACTIONS  There are no known drug/drug interactions with oral ALKERAN  Vaccinations with live organism vaccines are not recommended in immunocompromised individuals  Nalidixic acid together with high-dose intravenous melphalan has caused deaths in children due to haemorrhagic enterocolitis.
Impaired renal function has been described in bone marrow transplant patients who were conditioned with high-dose intravenous melphalan and who subsequently received cyclosporin to prevent graft-versus-host disease
The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity.
Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents.
Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids.
Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin;
Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide.
Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
Interaction with Other Central Nervous System Depressants: MEPERIDINE SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION AND IN REDUCED DOSAGE IN PATIENTS WHO ARE CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING OTHER NARCOTIC ANALGESICS, GENERAL ANESTHETICS, PHENOTHIAZINES, OTHER TRANQUILIZERS, SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS (INCLUDING BARBITURATES), TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS (INCLUDING ALCOHOL).
Some anticonvulsants may interact with Mephenytoin.
Those anticonvulsants include divalproex sodium, valproic acid, and phenobarbital.
Mephenytoin may also affect the effects of other drugs, which include some steroid medications, warfarin, certain heart medicines, birth control pills, anti-infective medicines, furosemide and theophylline Please note that Mephenytoin may interact with other drugs that are not listed here.
Mequitazine can interact with CNS depressant, antichlolinergic, TCA, MAOIs, and alcohol.
Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem.
Therefore, the coadministration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended.
There is evidence that meropenem may reduce serum levels of valproic acid to subtherapeutic levels (therapeutic range considered to be 50 to 100    g/mL total valproate).
ARAMINE should be used with caution in digitalized patients, since the combination of digitalis and sympathomimetic amines may cause ectopic arrhythmias.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the action of sympathomimetic amines.
SKELAXIN may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates and other CNS depressants.
Caution is advised for patients receiving high-dose aspirin and methazolamide concomitantly, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, coma and death have been reported with concomitant use of high-dose aspirin and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
Anticoagulants (oral): The activity of oral anticoagulants may be potentiated by anti-vitamin-K activity attributed to methimazole.
Digitalis glycosides: Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digitalis glycoside regimen become euthyroid;
Theophylline: Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid;
Dosages of concomitantly administered opioids should be reduced by approximately half, because levomepromazine amplifies the therapeutic actions and side-effects of opioids.
Combination with tramadol (Ultram) is associated with increased risk of seizures.
Additive sedative effects and confusional states may emerge if levomepromazine is given with benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
Exert particular caution in combining levomepromazine with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian-agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
Caffeine and/or stimulantes of the ephedrine/amphetamine type may counteract the specific actions of levomepromazine.
Since Celontin (methsuximide) may interact with concurrently administered antiepileptic drugs, periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (eg methsuximide may increase the plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenobarbital).
Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or ACTH.
Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine.
Thiazide drugs may increase the responsiveness of tubocurarine.
Lithium renal clearance is reduced by thiazides, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity.
Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs.
Potentiation occurs with ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs.
When methyldopa is used with other antihypertensive drugs, potentiation of antihypertensive effect may occur.
Patients may require reduced doses of anesthetics when on methyldopa.
When methyldopa and lithium are given concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of lithium toxicity.
Several studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of methyldopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate.
Coadministration of methyldopa with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate is not recommended.
Methyldopa does not interfere with measurement of VMA (vanillylmandelic acid), a test for pheochromocytoma, by those methods which convert VMA to vanillin.
CYP 3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors) There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of certain ergot alkaloid drugs (e.g. dihydroergotamine and ergotamine) and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, resulting in vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities.
Examples of some of the more potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin), HIV protease or reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine) or azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole).
Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole.
Caution should be exercised when Methergine    (methylergonovine maleate) is used concurrently with other vasoconstrictors or ergot alkaloids.
Ritalin may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine.
Human pharmacologic studies have shown that Ritalin may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine).
The safety of using methylphenidate in combination with clonidine or other centrally acting alpha-2 agonists has not been systemically evaluated.
Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone;
convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin.
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increased in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response.
Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance.
Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin.
This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn.
Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia.
The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable.
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids.
Methscopolamine may interact with antidepressants (tricyclic type), MAO inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, linezolid, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, selegiline, furazolidone), quinidine, amantadine, antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), other anticholinergics, potassium chloride supplements, antacids, absorbent-type anti-diarrhea medicines (e.g., kaolin-pectin), phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine, promethazine).
Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depression-producing drugs may increase the CNS depressant effects of methyprylon or these other medications.
Methysergide may reverse the analgesic activity of narcotic analgesics.
Concurrent use with vasoconstrictor agents including ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan, and nicotine (e.g. smoking) may result in enhanced vasoconstriction.
The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics.
Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers.
The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxi-dase inhibitors.
Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine).
Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.
Diuretics: Furosemide and probably other loop diuretics given concomitantly with metolazone can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes.
Other Antihypertensives: When MYKROX Tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, care must be taken, especially during initial therapy.
Alcohol, Barbiturates, and Narcotics: The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with metolazone therapy.
Digitalis Glycosides: Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to digitalis.
Corticosteroids or ACTH: May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention.
Lithium: Serum lithium levels may increase.
Curariform Drugs: Diuretic-induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of curariform drugs (such as tubocurarine) the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea.
Salicylates and Other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: May decrease the antihypertensive effects of MYKROX Tablets.
Sympathomimetics: Metolazone may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but this diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.
Methenamine: Efficacy may be decreased due to urinary alkalizing effect of metolazone.
Anticoagulants: Metolazone, as well as other thiazide-like diuretics, may affect the hypoprothrombinemic response to anticoagulants;
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents.
Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time.
Drug interactions should be kept in mind when METROGEL (metronidazole gel), 1% is prescribed for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment, although they are less likely to occur with topical metronidazole administration because of low absorption.
The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin;
Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity.
Caution should be observed in administering DEMSER to patients receiving phenothiazines or haloperidol because the extrapyramidal effects of these drugs can be expected to be potentiated by inhibition of catecholamine synthesis.
Concurrent use of DEMSER with alcohol or other CNS depressants can increase their sedative effects.
Since MEXITIL is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations.
In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2.
In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group.
In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine.
Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QTc, RR, and PR intervals than propafenone alone.
When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs with mexiletine is initiated, the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect.
In a large compassionate use program Mexitil    has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions.
A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy.
When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with Mexitil   , lowered Mexitil    plasma levels have been reported.
In a formal study, benzodiazepines were shown not to affect Mexitil    plasma concentrations.
ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent Mexitil    and digoxin, diuretics, or propranolol.
Concurrent administration of cimetidine and Mexitil    has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged Mexitil    plasma levels;
Mexitil    does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to Mexitil   , has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels.
Concurrent use of Mexitil    and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels.
This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting Mexitil   . Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre-Mexitil    values within 48 hours after discontinuing Mexitil   . If Mexitil and theophylline are to be used concurrently, theophylline blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the Mexitil    dose is changed.
Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50% following the administration of Mexitil   .
Posicor inhibits some of the liver's ability to metabolize some other drugs - terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, and tricyclic antidepressants.
A total of 11 clinical drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the potential for interaction between MYCAMINE and mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, prednisolone, sirolimus, nifedipine, fluconazole, ritonavir, and rifampin.
There was no effect of a single dose or multiple doses of MYCAMINE on mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, prednisolone, and fluconazole pharmacokinetics.
Sirolimus AUC was increased by 21% with no effect on Cmax in the presence of steady-state MYCAMINE compared with sirolimus alone.
Nifedipine AUC and Cmax were increased by 18% and 42%, respectively, in the presence of steady-state MYCAMINE compared with nifedipine alone.
Patients receiving sirolimus or nifedipine in combination with MYCAMINE should be monitored for sirolimus or nifedipine toxicity and sirolimus or nifedipine dosage should be reduced if necessary.
Drug Interactions: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system (ie, some drugs in the drug classes of azole antimycotics, protease inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and macrolide antibiotics).
Drugs such as erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered midazolam.
Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam.
Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral midazolam in adult studies.
The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate.
The sedative effect of VERSED Syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol.
No significant adverse interactions with common premedications (such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, and other muscle relaxants) or local anesthetics have been observed.
When administered concomitantly with ProAmatine   , cardiac glycosides may enhance or precipitate bradycardia, A.V.
The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of ProAmatine   . Therefore, caution should be used when ProAmatine    is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction.
ProAmatine    has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate), with or without salt supplementation.
ProAmatine. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of ProAmatine. Potential for Drug Interactions: It appears possible, although there is no supporting experimental evidence, that the high renal clearance of desglymidodrine (a base) is due to active tubular secretion by the base-secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, triamterene, flecainide, and quinidine.
Although specific drug or food interactions with mifepristone have not been studied, on the basis of this drug   s metabolism by CYP 3A4, it is possible that ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice may inhibit its metabolism (increasing serum levels of mifepristone).
Furthermore, rifampin, dexamethasone, St.
John   s Wort, and certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) may induce mifepristone metabolism (lowering serum levels of mifepristone).
While co-administration of ZAVESCA    appeared to increase the clearance of Cerezyme by 70%, these results are not conclusive because of the small number of subjects studied and because patients took variable doses of Cerezyme.
Combination therapy with Cerezyme    (imiglucerase) and ZAVESCA    is not indicated.
Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline class drugs in conjunction with penicillin.
Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
Interaction with Guanethidine: Although minoxidil does not itself cause orthostatic hypotension, its administration to patients already receiving guanethidine can result in profound orthostatic effects.
If at all possible guanethidine should be discontinued well before minoxidil is begun.
Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of REMERON SolTab    (mirtazapine) Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metab-olizing enzymes.
While in vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is not a potent inhibitor of any of these enzymes, an indication that mirtazapine is not likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes, the concomitant use of REMERON SolTab with most other drugs metabolized by these enzymes has not been formally studied.
Alcohol: Concomitant administration of alcohol (equivalent to 60 g) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine (15 mg) in 6 healthy male subjects.
However, the impairment of cognitive and motor skills produced by REMERON    were shown to be additive with those produced by alcohol.
Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking REMERON SolTab. Diazepam: Concomitant administration of diazepam (15 mg) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine (15 mg) in 12 healthy subjects.
However, the impairment of motor skills produced by REMERON has been shown to be additive with those caused by diazepam.
Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid diazepam and other similar drugs while taking REMERON SolTab.
Mitotane has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of warfarin by the mechanism of hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, leading to an increase in dosage requirements for warfarin.
Therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in anticoagulant dosage requirements when administering Mitotane to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants.
Although MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied.
Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents.
Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON.
The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied.
There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
Isoflurane and enflurane (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 M.C.
A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane.
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine.
While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher.
Some drug interactions are:  - birth control pills - corticosteroids - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as phenytoin or carbamazepine - certain antibiotics given by injection - cisplatin - edrophonium - neostigmine - polymyxin B or bacitracin - local anesthetics such as procaine - general anesthetics - succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants
Diuretics: Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when ACE inhibitors are started.
The possibility of hypotensive effects with UNIVASC    can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with UNIVASC   . If this is not possible, the starting dose of moexpril should be reduced..
Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: UNIVASC    can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion.
Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
Oral Anticoagulants: Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect.
Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium.
If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.
Other Agents: No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when UNIVASC    was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine.
UNIVASC    has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H2 blockers, digoxin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and cholesterol-lowering agents.
However, ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, may increase plasma levels of mometasone furoate during concomitant dosing.
Montelukast at a Dose of 10 mg Once Daily Dosed to Pharmacokinetic Steady State  - did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline (predominantly a cytochrome P450 1A2 substrate).
- did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (a substrate of cytochromes P450 2A6 and 2C9) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the INR (International Normalized Ratio).
- did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4) or fexofenadine, its carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily.
Montelukast at Doses of    100 mg Daily Dosed to Pharmacokinetic Steady State:  - did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg.
- did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone.
Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast.
It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast.
In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin.
These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants.
Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast.
It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast.
Use with Other Central Nervous System Depressants: The depressant effects of morphine are potentiated by the presence of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, antihistaminics, or psychotropic drugs.
Use of neuroleptics in conjunction with oral morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension and profound sedation or coma.
Interaction with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, or buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a proof opioid agonist analgesic.
Antacids: Absorption of a single dose of Myfortic was decreased when administered to 12 stable renal transplant patients also taking magnesium-aluminum containing antacids (30 mL): the mean Cmax and AUC(0-t) values for MPA were 25% and 37% lower, respectively, than when Myfortic was administered alone under fasting conditions.
It is recommended that Myfortic and antacids not be administered simultaneously.
Cyclosporine: When studied in stable renal transplant patients, cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by steady state dosing of Myfortic.
Acyclovir/Ganciclovir: may be taken with Myfortic;
Both acyclovir/ganciclovir and MPAG concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, their coexistence may compete for tubular secretion and further increase in the concentrations of the two.
Azathioprine/Mycophenolate Mofetil: Given that azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that Myfortic not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.
Cholestyramine and Drugs that Bind Bile Acids: These drugs interrupt enterohepatic recirculation and reduce MPA exposure when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil.
Therefore, do not administer Myfortic with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, for example bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfortic.
Oral Contraceptives: Given the different metabolism of Myfortic and oral contraceptives, no drug interaction between these two classes of drug is expected.
However, in a drug-drug interaction study, mean levonorgesterol AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil.
Therefore, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are co- administered with Myfortic with caution and additional birth control methods be considered.
Live Vaccines: During treatment with Myfortic, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective.
Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption.
Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron.
Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased.
However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3  Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5  Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P 388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron.
In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.
ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.
Other beta adrenergic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with Alupent    (metaproterenol sulfate USP) because they may have additive effects.
Beta adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of beta adrenergic agonists on the vascular system may be potentiated.
Alcohol: In a multiple-dose study in 30 normal weight subjects, coadministration of XENICAL and 40 grams of alcohol (e.g., approximately 3 glasses of wine) did not result in alteration of alcohol pharmacokinetics, orlistat pharmacodynamics (fecal fat excretion), or systemic exposure to orlistat.
Cyclosporine: Preliminary data from a XENICAL and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when XENICAL was coadministered with cyclosporine.
Digoxin: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin.
Fat-soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues: A pharmacokinetic interaction study showed a 30% reduction in beta-carotene supplement absorption when concomitantly administered with XENICAL.
XENICAL inhibited absorption of a vitamin E acetate supplement by approximately 60%.
The effect of orlistat on the absorption of supplemental vitamin D, vitamin A, and nutritionally-derived vitamin K is not known at this time.
Glyburide: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 80 mg three times a day for 5 days, orlistat did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (blood glucose-lowering) of glyburide.
Nifedipine (extended-release tablets): In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not alter the bioavailability of nifedipine (extended-release tablets).
Oral Contraceptives: In 20 normal-weight female subjects, the treatment of XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 23 days resulted in no changes in the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives.
Phenytoin: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 7 days, XENICAL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 300-mg dose of phenytoin.
Pravastatin: In a 2-way crossover study of 24 normal-weight, mildly hypercholesterolemic patients receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin.
Warfarin: In 12 normal-weight subjects, administration of XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 16 days did not result in any change in either warfarin pharmacokinetics (both R- and S-enantiomers) or pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time and serum Factor VII).
Although undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a marker of vitamin K nutritional status, was unaltered with XENICAL administration, vitamin K levels tended to decline in subjects taking XENICAL.
Therefore, as vitamin K absorption may be decreased with XENICAL, patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin who are prescribed XENICAL should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters.
Tetracycline, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactericidal effect of penicillin and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg/m2 ELOXATIN and infusional 5-FU has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks.
Increases of 5-FU plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m2 ELOXATIN dosed every 3 weeks.
Anticoagulants Anabolic steroids may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants.
Warfarin: A multidose study of oxandrolone, given as 5 or 10 mg BID in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with warfarin, resulted in a mean increase in S-warfarin half-life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4.55 to 12.08 ng*hr/mL: similar increases in R-warfarin half-life and AUC were also detected.
A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of warfarin dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5.
When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved.
Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued.
Oral hypoglycemic agents Oxandrolone may inhibit the metabolism of oral hypoglycemic agents.
Adrenal steroids or ACTH In patients with edema, concomitant administration with adrenal cortical steroids or ACTH may increase the edema.
The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects.
Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when DITROPAN XL was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.
Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC).
Concurrent ingestion of antacid (20 mL of antacid containing aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) did not significantly affect the exposure of oxybutynin or desethyloxybutynin.
The CNS depressant effects of oxycodone hydrochloride may be additive with that of other CNS depressants..
The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects.
Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.
It has been reported that the incidence of bradycardia was increased when oxymorphone was combined with propofol for induction of anesthesia.
In addition, CNS toxicity has been reported (confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics;
Potential for INVEGA    to Affect Other Drugs Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes.
Given the primary CNS effects of paliperidone, INVEGA    should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.
Paliperidone may antagonize the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists.
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVEGA    Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely.
Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin, midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin.
Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary.
There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly.
Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.
Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts).
Laboratory Tests There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving most proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole.
A multiple dose drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that ketoconazole approximately doubled paricalcitol AUC0-   . Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A and ketoconazole le is known to be a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme, care should be taken while dosing paricalcitol with ketoconazole and other strong P450 3A inhibitors including atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole.
Dose adjustment of Zemplar Capsules may be required, and iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole.
Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of Zemplar Capsules.
patients receiving lithium and Neulasta should have more frequent monitoring of neutrophil counts.
In a pharmacokinetic study of 18 chronic hepatitis C patients concomitantly receiving methadone, treatment with PEG-Intron once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with a mean increase of 16% in methadone AUC;
Acromegalic patients with diabetes mellitus being treated with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents may require dose reductions of these therapeutic agents after the initiation of therapy with SOMAVERT.
In clinical studies, patients on opioids often needed higher serum pegvisomant concentrations to achieve appropriate IGF-I suppression compared with patients not receiving opioids.
Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA.
Although ibuprofen (400 mg qid) can be administered with ALIMTA in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance    80 mL/min), caution should be used when administering ibuprofen concurrently with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min).
Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency should avoid taking NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half-lives, all patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following ALIMTA administration.
The interaction of CYLERT (pemoline) with other drugs has not been studied in humans.
Decreased seizure threshold has been reported in patients receiving CYLERT concomitantly with antiepileptic medications.
Concurrent administration of bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, tetracycline) may diminish the bactericidal effects of penicillins by slowing the rate of bacterial growth.
Penicillin blood levels may be prolonged by concurrent administration of probenecid which blocks the renal tubular secretion of penicillins.
Displacement of penicillin from plasma protein binding sites will elevate the level of free penicillin in the serum.
Usage with Alcohol: Due to the potential for increased CNS depressants effects, alcohol should be used with caution in patients who are currently receiving pentazocine.
Although a causal relationship has not been established, there have been reports of bleeding and/or prolonged prothrombin time in patients treated with TRENTAL with and without anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors.
Concomitant administration of TRENTAL and theophylline-containing drugs leads to increased theophylline levels and theophylline toxicity in some individuals.
TRENTAL has been used concurrently with antihypertensive drugs, beta blockers, digitalis, diuretics, antidiabetic agents, and antiarrhythmics, without observed problems.
Dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthines ) or metoclopramide, ordinarily should not be administered concurrently with Permax (a dopamine agonist);
Because pergolide mesylate is approximately 90% bound to plasma proteins, caution should be exercised if pergolide mesylate is coadministered with other drugs known to affect protein binding.
Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of ACEON    Tablets therapy.
The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril.
If diuretics cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of ACEON    Tablets, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour.
The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics.
The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition.
Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: ACEON    Tablets may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production.
Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
Lithium: Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy.
Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity.
Digoxin: A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with ACEON    Tablets, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded.
Gentamicin: Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin.
Food Interaction: Oral administration of ACEON    Tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of perindopril absorption relative to the fasted state.
However, the extent of biotransformation of perindopril to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant.
Concomitant use of alcohol with phentermine hydrochloride may result in an adverse drug interaction.
Vasopressors, particularly metaraminol, may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia and therefore should be used only with great caution or not at all.
MAO Inhibitors: The pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines is markedly potentiated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).
The pressor response of adrenergic agents may also be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants.
Vasopressors, particularly metaraminol, may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia and therefore should be used only with great caution or not at all.
MAO Inhibitors - The pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines is markedly potentiated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).
The pressor response of adrenergic agents may also be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants.
Pilocarpine should be administered with caution to patients taking beta adrenergic antagonists because of the possibility of conduction disturbances.
These effects should be considered when anticholinergic properties may be contributing to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication (e.g., atropine, inhaled ipratropium).
While no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, the following concomitant drugs were used in at least 10% of patients in either or both Sj   grens efficacy studies: acetylsalicylic acid, artificial tears, calcium, conjugated estrogens, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, ibuprofen, levothyroxine sodium, medroxyprogesterone acetate, methotrexate, multivitamins, naproxen, omeprazole, paracetamol, and prednisone.
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents.
Pindolol has been used with a variety of antihypertensive agents, including hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and guanethidine without unexpected adverse interactions.
Pindolol has been shown to increase serum thioridazine levels when both drugs are co-administered.
Other short-acting beta adrenergic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with MAXAIR AUTOHALER because they may have additive effects.
Although this has not occurred in in vitro studies with coumarin-type anticoagulants, interactions with coumarin-type anticoagulants have been reported with FELDENE since marketing, therefore, physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering FELDENE to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants and other highly protein-bound drugs.
Plasma levels of piroxicam are depressed to approximately 80% of their normal values when FELDENE is administered in conjunction with aspirin (3900 mg/day), but concomitant administration of antacids has no effect on piroxicam plasma levels . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including FELDENE, have been reported to increase steady state plasma lithium levels.
It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing FELDENE.
When atropine and pralidoxime are used together, the signs of atropinization (flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, dryness of the mouth and nose) may occur earlier than might be expected when atropine is used alone.
This is especially true if the total dose of atropine has been large and the administration of pralidoxime has been delayed.
2 - 4 The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning, although they do not bear directly on the use of pralidoxime: since barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions;
morphine, theophylline, aminophylline, succinylcholine, reserpine, and phenothiazine-type tranquilizers should be avoided in patients with organophosphate poisoning.
Carbidopa/Levodopa: Carbidopa/Levodopa does not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole in healthy volunteers (N= 10).
Selegiline: In healthy volunteers (N= 11), selegiline did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole.
Amantadine: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that amantadine is unlikely to alter the oral clearance of pramipexole (N= 54).
Cimetidine: Cimetidine, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in pramipexole AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N= 12).
Probenecid: Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the aruonic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N= 12).
Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole.
CYP interactions: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro.
Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MIRAPEX.
Due to its effects on gastric emptying, SYMLIN therapy should not be considered for patients taking drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility (e.g., anticholinergic agents such as atropine) and agents that slow the intestinal absorption of nutrients (e.g., alpha glucosidase inhibitors).
When the rapid onset of a concomitant orally administered agent is a critical determinant of effectiveness (such as analgesics), the agent should be administered at least 1 hour prior to or 2 hours after SYMLIN injection.
In clinical trials, the concomitant use of sulfonylureas or biguanides did not alter the adverse event profile of SYMLIN.
No formal interaction studies have been performed to assess the effect of SYMLIN on the kinetics of oral antidiabetic agents.
Mixing SYMLIN and Insulin The pharmacokinetic parameters of SYMLIN were altered when mixed with regular, NPH, and 70/30 premixed formulations of recombinant human insulin immediately prior to injection.
Thus, SYMLIN and insulin should not be mixed and must be administered separately.
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response.
Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance.
Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin.
This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn.
Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia.
The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable.
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulants when given concurrently with corticosteroids.
Anticholinesterases: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and anticholinesterase agents may result in increased systemic toxicity since anticholinesterases inhibit the breakdown of procaine hydrochloride.
CNS depressant medications: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and CNS depressant medications may result in additive depressant effects.
Hyaluronidase: Hyaluronidase may increase the diffusion rate of procaine hydrochloride, resulting in a decreased time of onset, but an increase in systemic toxicity.
Neuromuscular blocking agents (such as suxamethonium chloride): Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and neuromuscular blocking agents may result in prolongation or enhancement of the neuromuscular blockade.
Sulfonamides: Concurrent use of procaine hydrochloride and sulfonamides may result in a reduction of the antibacterial action of the sulfonamide.
Acetazolamide: Concurrent use of acetazolamide and procaine hydrochloride may extend the plasma half-life of procaine.
To minimize CNS depression and possible potentiation, barbiturates, antihistamines, narcotics, hypotensive agents or phenothiazines should be used with caution.
Because Matulane exhibits some monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, sympathomimetic drugs, tricyclic antidepressant drugs (e.g., amitriptyline HCl, imipramine HCl) and other drugs and foods with known high tyramine content, such as wine, yogurt, ripe cheese and bananas, should be avoided.
No cross-resistance with other chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy or steroids has been demonstrated.
Thiazide diuretics may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that may occur with phenothiazines.
Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly.
Concomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.
The induction dose requirements of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion may be reduced in patients with intramuscular or intravenous premedication, particularly with narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl, etc.)
and combinations of opioids and sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, droperidol, etc.).
During maintenance of anesthesia or sedation, the rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration should be adjusted according to the desired level of anesthesia or sedation and may be reduced in the presence of supplemental analgesic agents (eg, nitrous oxide or opioids).
The concurrent administration of potent inhalational agents (eg, isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane) during maintenance with DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion has not been extensively evaluated.
DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion does not cause a clinically significant change in onset, intensity, or duration of action of the commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, succinylcholine and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants).
No significant adverse interactions with commonly used premedications or drugs used during anesthesia or sedation (including a range of muscle relaxants, inhalational agents, analgesic agents, and local anesthetic agents) have been observed.
The CNS-depressant effect of propoxyphene is additive with that of other CNS depressants, including alcohol.
Such occurrences have been reported when propoxyphene was administered to patients on antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or warfarin-like drugs.
MAO inhibitors and beta adrenergic blockers increase the effects of pseudoephedrine.
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids.
Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics.
Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored.
Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.
Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine causes a 60% reduction in the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene and should not be coadministered with EVISTA.
Warfarin: The coadministration of EVISTA and warfarin has not been assessed under chronic conditions.
If EVISTA is given concurrently with warfarin, prothrombin time should be monitored.
In vitro, raloxifene did not affect the binding of warfarin, phenytoin, or tamoxifen.
Caution should be used when EVISTA is coadministered with other highly protein-bound drugs, such as clofibrate, indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen, diazepam, and diazoxide.
Coadministration of TRITEC with clarithromycin resulted in increased plasma ranitidine concentrations (57%), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48%), and increased 14- hydroxy- clarithromycin plasma concentrations (31%).
Coadministration with aspirin results in a slight decrease in the rate of salicylate absorption that is clinically unimportant.
Coadministration with a high dose of antacid (170 mEq) results in a 28% decrease in plasma concentrations of ranitidine and may decrease plasma concentrations of bismuth from TRITEC.
For information on drug interactions associated with ranitidine, refer to the ZANTAC     package insert.
Co-administration of oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased retapamulin geometric mean AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin ointment, 1% on the abraded skin of healthy adult males.
Due to low systemic exposure to retapamulin following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments for retapamulin are unnecessary when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole.
Based on in vitro P450 inhibition studies and the low systemic exposure observed following topical application of ALTABAX, retapamulin is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other P450 substrates.
In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as aspirin, dipyridamole, and abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to or after Retavase    therapy.
Interactions for Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin):  Alcohol - impairs the intestinal absorption of riboflavin
Probenecid - concurrent use decreases gastrointestinal absorption of riboflavin;
requirements for riboflavin may be increased in patients receiving probenecid.
Cimetidine: The effects of chronic cimetidine use on the metabolism of rimantadine are not known.
When a single 100 mg dose of rimantadine HCl was administered one hour after the initiation of Cimetidine (300 mg four times a day), the apparent total rimantadine clearance of this single dose in normal healthy adults was reduced by 18% (compared to the apparent total rimantadine clearance in the same subjects in the absence of cimetidine).
Acetaminophen: Rimantadine HCl, 100 mg, was given twice daily for 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers.
Coadministration with acetaminophen reduced the peak concentration and AUC values for rimantadine by approximately 11%.
Aspirin: Rimantadine HCl, 100 mg, was given twice daily fro 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers.
Peak plasma concentrations and AUC of rimantadine were reduced approximately 10% in the presence of aspirin.
Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of Exelon    (rivastigmine tartrate) on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases.
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers.
The elevation of prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of Exelon.
Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Exelon: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine.
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of rivastigmine is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine.
Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids (n=77), antihypertensives (n=72), calcium channel blockers (n=75), antidiabetics (n=21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=79), estrogens (n=70), salicylate analgesics (n=177), antianginals (n=35), and antihistamines (n=15).
Use with Anticholinergics: Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications.
Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors: A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.
Drug Interactions: The use of ZEMURON    (rocuronium bromide) Injection before succinylcholine, for the purpose of attenuating some of the side effects of succinylcholine, has not been studied.
If ZEMURON    is administered following administration of succinylcholine, it should not be given until recovery from succinylcholine has been observed.
The median duration of action of ZEMURON    0.6 mg/kg administered after a 1 mg/kg dose of succinylcholine when T 1 returned to 75% of control was 36 minutes (range 14-57, n=12) vs.
There are no controlled studies documenting the use of ZEMURON    before or after other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.
Ropivacaine should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anesthetics or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics, since the toxic effects of these drugs are additive.
In vivo, the plasma clearance of ropivacaine was reduced by 70% during coadministration of fluvoxamine (25 mg bid for 2 days), a selective and potent CYP1A2 inhibitor.
Thus strong inhibitors of cytochrome P4501A2, such as fluvoxamine, given concomitantly during administration of Ropivacaine, can interact with Ropivacaine leading to increased ropivacaine plasma levels.
Possible interactions with drugs known to be metabolized by CYP1A2 via competitive inhibition such as theophylline and imipramine may also occur.
Coadministration of a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (100 mg bid for 2 days with ropivacaine infusion administered 1 hour after ketoconazole) caused a 15% reduction in in-vivo plasma clearance of ropivacaine.
An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (such as gemfibrozil) may increase the AUC of rosiglitazone and an inducer of CYP2C8 (such as rifampin) may decrease the AUC of rosiglitazone.
Concomitant administrations not recommended:  - Terfenadine and astemizole: Certain macrolides interact with terfenadine and astemizole leading to increased serum concentrations of the latter.
Although such a reaction has not been demonstrated with roxithromycin, concomitant administration of roxithromycin with terfenadine or astemizole is not recommended.
- Cisapride, pimozide: Other drugs such as cisapride or pimozide, which are metabolised by hepatic CYP3A isozymes have been associated with QT interval prolongation and/or cardiac arrythmias (typically torsades de pointe) as a result of increase in their serum level subsequent to interaction with significant inhibitors of the isozyme, including some macrolide antibacterials.
Although such a risk is not verified for roxithromycin, combination of roxithromycin with such drugs is not recommended.
however, in patients with Paget's Disease prior diphosphonate use appears to reduce the anti-resorptive response to Calcitonin (salmon) nasal spray.
ASPIRIN AND OTHER SALICYLATE DRUGS WILL BE ADDITIVE TO DISALCID AND MAY INCREASE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF SALICYLIC ACID TO TOXIC LEVELS.
Salicylates given concomitantly with anticoagulant drugs may predispose to systemic bleeding.
Salicylates may enhance the hypoglycemic effect of oral antidiabetic drugs of the sulfonylurea class.
Salicylate competes with a number of drugs for protein binding sites, notably penicillin, thiopental, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, phenytoin, sulfinpyrazone, naproxen, warfarin, methotrexate, and possibly corticosteroids.
Drugs which may potentiate the myeloproliferative effects of Leukine, such as lithium and corticosteroids, should be used with caution.
Scopolamine should be used with care in patients taking other drugs that are capable of causing CNS effects such as sedatives, tranquilizers, or alcohol.
e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, antihistamines (including meclizine), tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants.
Barbiturates may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, certain antibiotics, quinidine, theophylline, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and beta blockers.
The occurrence of stupor, muscular rigidity, severe agitation, and elevated temperature has been reported in some patients receiving the combination of selegiline and meperidine.
This is typical of the interaction of meperidine and MAOIs.
Severe toxicity has also been reported in patients receiving the combination of tricyclic antidepressants and ELDEPRYL and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and ELDEPRYL.
One case of hypertensive crisis has been reported in a patient taking the recommended doses of selegiline and a sympathomimetic medication (ephedrine).
Digoxin: There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the co-administration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days.
No dosage adjustment of digoxin or JANUVIA is recommended.
norepinephrine and dobutamine are incompatible with sodium bicarbonate solution.
The addition of sodium bicarbonate to parenteral solutions containing calcium should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established.
Do not exceed a 5 mg daily dose of VESIcare when administered with therapeutic doses of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin on the QT interval in 76 healthy women, the QT prolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin 10 mg than with 30 mg (three times the maximum recommended dose), and the effect of solifenacin 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose.
If glucocorticoid replacement is required, the glucocorticoid dose should be carefully adjusted.
Limited published data indicate that GH treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450) mediated antipyrine clearance in man.
These data suggest that GH administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporin).
Caution is recommended when administering NEXAVAR with compounds that are metabolized/eliminated predominantly by the UGT1A1 pathway (e.g. irinotecan).
Concomitant treatment with NEXAVAR resulted in a 21% increase in the AUC of doxorubicin.
Caution is recommended when administering doxorubicin with NEXAVAR.
Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine.
Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with ZERIT should be avoided.
In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is also inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin and ribavirin.
The interaction of Streptase, Streptokinase, with other drugs has not been well studied.
Use of Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents -- Streptase, Streptokinase, alone or in combination with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, may cause bleeding complications.
In the treatment of acute MI, aspirin, when not otherwise contraindicated, should be administered with Streptokinase ( see below ).
Anticoagulation and Antiplatelets After Treatment for Myocardial Infarction -- In the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the use of aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of reinfarction and stroke.
The addition of aspirin to Streptokinase causes a minimal increase in the risk of minor bleeding (3.9% vs. 3.1%), but does not appear to increase the incidence of major bleeding (see
Streptozocin has been reported to prolong the elimination half-life of doxorubicin and may lead to severe bone marrow suppression;
a reduction of the doxorubicin dosage should be considered in patients receiving ZANOSAR concurrently.
The concurrent use of streptozocin and phenytoin has been reported in one case to result in reduced streptozocin cytotoxicity.
CHEMET is not known to interact with other drugs including iron supplements;
Concomitant administration of CHEMET with other chelation therapy, such as CaNa 2 EDTA is not recommended.
Sulfamethizole may increase the effects of barbiturates, tolbutamide, and uricosurics.
It may also interact with thiazides (increased thrombocytopenia), cyclosporine (increased nephrotoxicity), sulfonylurea agents (increased hypoglycemic response), warfarin (increased anticoagulant effect), methotrexate (decreased renal excretion of methotrexate), phenytoin (decreased hepatic clearance of phenytoin).
In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombopenia with purpura has been reported.
It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin.
Sulfamethoxazole may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.
At a 1.6-g dose, sulfamethoxazole produced a slight but significant increase in the half-life of phenytoin but did not produce a corresponding decrease in the metabolic clearance rate.
Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein-binding sites, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.
Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have been reported when those agents were administered concomitantly with sulfasalazine.
When daily doses of sulfasalazine 2 g and weekly doses of methotrexate 7.5 mg were coadministered to 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients in a drug-drug interaction study, the pharmacokinetic disposition of the drugs was not altered.
Daily doses of sulfasalazine 2 g (maximum 3 g) and weekly doses of methotrexate 7.5 mg (maximum 15 mg) were administered alone or in combination to 310 rheumatoid arthritis patients in two controlled 52-week clinical studies.
Sulfoxone may increase the effects of barbiturates, tolbutamide, and uricosurics.
It may also interact with thiazides (increased thrombocytopenia), cyclosporine (increased nephrotoxicity), sulfonylurea agents (increased hypoglycemic response), warfarin (increased anticoagulant effect), methotrexate (decreased renal excretion of methotrexate), phenytoin (decreased hepatic clearance of phenytoin).
Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure.
Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been reported, rarely, to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with sumatriptan.
If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
Co-administration of SUTENT with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconizole) may increases sunitinib concentrations.
Co-administration of SUTENT with inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, St. Johns Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Other eye drops or medications such as acetylcholine chloride (Miochol) and carbachol (Carboptic, Isopto Carbachol) may decrease the effects of suprofen ophthalmic.
Drug-Drug Interactions: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha-adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined.
However, interactions may be expected and FLOMAX capsules should NOT be used in combination with other alpha-adrenergic blocking agents.
The pharmacokinetic interaction between cimetidine and FLOMAX capsules was investigated.
Therefore, FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg.
Results from limited in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction studies between tamsulosin HCI and warfarin are inconclusive.
Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules.
Administration of valproic acid decreases oral clearance of temozolomide by about 5%.
Patients studied in clinical trials of TNKase were routinely treated with heparin and aspirin.
Anticoagulants (such as heparin and vitamin K antagonists) and drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after TNKase therapy.
In a study in which 34 different drugs were tested, therapeutically relevant concentrations of tolbutamide, sodium salicylate and sulfamethizole displaced protein-bound teniposide in fresh human serum to a small but significant extent.
Therefore, caution should be used in administering VUMON (teniposide injection) to patients receiving these other agents.
There was no change in the plasma kinetics of teniposide when coadministered with methotrexate.
An increase in intracellular levels of methotrexate was observed in vitro in the presence of teniposide.
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine.
This may be of clinical relevance for compounds predominantly metabolized by this enzyme, such as tricyclic antidepressants,    -blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) Type B, if they have a narrow therapeutic window.
In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in normal volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin.
Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%.
Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%.
There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between LAMISIL    Tablets and these changes has not been established.
Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CyP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CyP450 enzyme inhibitor.
Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine.
There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.
Ketoconazole: Spontaneous adverse reaction reports of patients taking concomitant ketoconazole with recommended doses of terfenadine demonstrate QT interval prolongation and rare serious cardiac events, e.g.
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in elevated plasma terfenadine levels.
Concomitant administration of ketoconazole and terfenadine is contraindicated.
Itraconazole: Torsades de pointes and elevated parent terfenadine levels have been reported during concomitant use of terfenadine and itraconazole in clinical trials of itraconazole and from foreign post-marketing sources.
Concomitant administration of itraconazole and terfenadine is contraindicated.
Due to the chemical similarity of other azole-type antifungal agents (including fluconazole, metronidazole, and miconazole) to ketoconazole, and itraconazole, concomitant use of these products with terfenadine is not recommended pending full examination of potential interactions.
Macrolides: Clinical drug interaction studies indicate that erythromycin and clarithromycin can exert an effect on terfenadine metabolism by a mechanism which may be similar to that of ketoconazole, but to a lesser extent.
A few spontaneous accounts of QT interval prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes, have been reported in patients receiving erythromycin or troleandomycin.
Concomitant administration of terfenadine with clarithromycin, erythromycin, or troleandomycin is contraindicated: Pending full characterization of potential interactions, concomitant administration of terfenadine with other macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, is not recommended.
Studies to evaluate potential interactions of terfenadine with azithromycin are in progress.
When administered concurrently, testolactone may increase the effects of oral anticoagulants;
Thalidomide has been reported to enhance the sedative activity of barbiturates, alcohol, chlorpromazine, and reserpine.
Oral Contraceptives: In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 75    g of ethinyl estradiol were studied.
Important Non-Thalidomide Drug Interactions Drugs That Interfere with Hormonal Contraceptives: Concomitant use of HIV-protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or certain herbal supplements such as St.
John's Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception and up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies.
Thiabendazole may compete with other drugs, such as theophylline, for sites of metabolism in the liver, thus elevating the serum levels of such compounds to potentially toxic levels.
Therefore, when concomitant use of thiabendazole and xanthine derivatives is anticipated, it may be necessary to monitor blood levels and/or reduce the dosage of such compounds.
Interactions for Vitamin B1 (Thiamine):  Loop Diuretics, Oral Contraceptives, Stavudine, Tricyclic Antidepressants
Phenothiazines are capable of potentiating CNS depressants (e.g., barbiturates, anesthetics, opiates, alcohol, etc.)
as well as atropine and phosphorous insecticides.
There is usually complete cross-resistance between PURINETHOL (mercaptopurine) and TABLOID brand Thioguanine.
As there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulphasalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, they should be administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent thioguanine therapy.
Caution should be exercised when administering ZADAXIN therapy in combination with other immunomodulating drugs.
Prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored if tigecycline is administered with warfarin.
Concurrent use of antibacterial drugs with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
The bioavailability of SKELID is decreased 80% by calcium, when calcium and SKELID are administered at the same time, and 60% by some aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids, when administered 1 hour before SKELID.
Aspirin may decrease bioavailability of SKELID by up to 50% when taken 2 hours after SKELID.
The bioavailability of SKELID is increased 2-4 fold by indomethacin but is not significantly altered by coadministration of diclofenac.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin are not significantly modified by SKELID coadministration.
In vitro studies show that tiludronate does not displace warfarin from its binding site on protein.
These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids.
However, the co   administration of SPIRIVA with other anticholinergic   containing drugs (e.g., ipratropium) has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.
AGGRASTAT has been studied on a background of aspirin and heparin.
The use of AGGRASTAT, in combination with heparin and aspirin, has been associated with an increase in bleeding compared to heparin and aspirin alone (see
In clinical studies of TOBI, patients taking TOBI concomitantly with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME   , Genentech), (beta)-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, or parenteral aminoglycosides demonstrated adverse experience profiles similar to the study population as a whole.
Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue.
TOBI should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or mannitol.
The in vitro binding of warfarin to human plasma proteins is unaffected by tolmetin, and tolmetin does not alter the prothrombin time of normal volunteers.
However, increased prothrombin time and bleeding have been reported in patients on concomitant TOLECTIN and warfarin therapy.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering TOLECTIN to patients on anticoagulants.
In adult diabetic patients under treatment with either sulfonylureas or insulin there is no change in the clinical effects of either TOLECTIN or the hypoglycemic agents.
Caution should be used if TOLECTIN is administered concomitantly with methotrexate.
TOLECTIN and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model, possibly enhancing the toxicity of methotrexate.
CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions).
For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (eg, itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of DETROL LA is 2 mg daily.
Administration of paclitaxel in combination with HERCEPTIN resulted in a two-fold decrease in HERCEPTIN clearance in a non-human primate study and in a 1.5-fold increase in HERCEPTIN serum levels in clinical studies.
Trilostane may interact with aminoglutethimide or mitotane (causing too great a decrease in adrenal function).
Trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.
Trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 51% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 30%.
Since trimetrexate is metabolized by a P450 enzyme system, drugs that induce or inhibit this drug metabolizing enzyme system may elicit important drug-drug interactions that may alter trimetrexate plasma concentrations.
Agents that might be coadministered with trimetrexate in AIDS patients for other indications that could elicit this activity include erythromycin, rifampin, rifabutin, ketoconazole, and fluconazole.
In vitro perfusion of isolated rat liver has shown that cimetidine caused a significant reduction in trimetrexate metabolism and that acetaminophen altered the relative concentration of trimetrexate metabolites possibly by competing for sulfate metabolites.
Based on an in vitro rat liver model, nitrogen substituted imidazole drugs (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) were potent, non-competitive inhibitors of trimetrexate metabolism.
Triprolidine may enhance the sedative effects of central nervous system depressants including alcohol, barbiturates, hypnotics, narcotic analgesics, sedatives, and tranquillisers.
The effects of anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine and tricyclic antidepressants may be enhanced by the concomitant administration of triprolidine.
The concomitant use of Sanctura with other anticholinergic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects.
Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion: Although studies to assess drug-drug interactions with Sanctura have not been conducted, Sanctura has the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g. digoxin, procainamide, pancuronium, morphine, vancomycin, metformin and tenofovir).
Coadministration of Sanctura with drugs that are eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may increase the serum concentration of Sanctura and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway.
Concomitant administration of vancomycin and anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema and histamine-like flushing and anaphylactoid reactions.
Concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, bacitracin, polymyxin B, colistin, viomycin, or cisplatin, when indicated, requires careful monitoring.
A study published in 2002 found that vigabatrin causes a statistically significant increase in plasma clearance of carbamazepine.
In 1984, Drs Rimmer and Richens at the University of Wales reported that administering vigabatrin with phenytoin lowered the serum phenytoin concentration in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy.
Vindesine can interact with the drugs of the following categories:  - Blood dyscrasia: can cause unpredictable myelotoxicity - Bone marrow depressants: can cause a predictable dose-related myelotoxicity - Radiation therapy: may cause marrow depression - Neurotoxic medications: can cause neurologic toxicity - Phenytoin: can increase seizure activity - Live virus vaccines: may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus, may increase the side effects of the vaccination, and decrease patient's response to the vaccine - Mitomycin-C: may cause shortness of breath and bronchospasm - Killed virus vaccines: may decrease patient's response to the vaccine
Drug Interactions: Women on oral contraceptives have shown a significant increase in plasma vitamin A levels.
Limited evidence suggests that ascorbic acid may influence the intensity and duration of action of bishydroxycoumarin.
Coumarin-Derivative Anticoagulants: Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were observed in patients receiving ZOLINZA concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants.
Physicians should carefully monitor PT and INR in patients concurrently administered ZOLINZA and coumarin derivatives.
Other HDAC Inhibitors Severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported with concomitant use of ZOLINZA and other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., valproic acid).
