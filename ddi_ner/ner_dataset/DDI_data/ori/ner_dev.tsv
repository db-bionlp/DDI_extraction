Rifampin and warfarin: a drug interaction.
The drug interaction between warfarin and rifampin is not well known.
Rifampin has been reported to increase the warfarin requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
The concomitant administration of rifampin and warfarin resulted in the need for an unusually high maintenance dose of warfarin (20 mg per day) in order to produce a therapeutic effect.
Withdrawal of rifampin decreased the warfarin requirement by 50%.
This effect may be mediated by the ability of rifampin to induce microsomal enzymes and, thus, the catabolism of warfarin.
The effect of rifampin on the warfarin requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of rifampin and extended a similar length of time after rifampin withdrawal.
To study the pancreatic effects of other agents, dynamic insulin and glucagon release was measured from the in vitro perfused pancreases of normal and diabetic Chinese hamsters in response to various combinations of arginine (20mM), glucose (100 or 150 mg. per 100 ml.), and theophylline (10 mM).
Glucose, alone and in the presence of theophylline, caused subnormal insulin release and less suppression of glucagon release in the diabectics than in the normals.
Arginine, in the presence of glucose and theophylline, caused excessive glucagon release but nearly normal insulin release in the diabetics.
Arginine, in the absence of glucose or theophylline, caused excessive glucagon release in the diabetics and undetectable insulin release in either diabetics or normals.
Further, these results confirm that the diabetic Chinese hamster's alpha and beta cells respond normally to theophylline, but are relatively insensitive to glucose.
The effects of ketamine and of Innovar anesthesia on digitalis tolerance in dogs.
In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, Innovar Vet, or pentobarbital, the dosage of ouabain needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
Ventricular tachycardia induced by ouabain was generally converted to sinus rhythm following administration of Innovar, ketamine, or droperidol but not after administration of fentayl alone or after pentobarbital.
The literature provides considerable evidence indicating that several, but not all antihistaminics, are indeed analgesic agents and some are analgesic adjuvants as well.
Those for which effectiveness is reported includes diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, orphenadrine, pyrilamine, phenyltoloxamine, promethazine, methdilazine, and tripelennamine.
[The GABA-ergic system and brain edema]
[Stimulation by cerulein--an analog of the octapeptide cholecystokinin--of 3H-spiroperidol binding after the long-term administration of neuroleptics]
After prolonged administration of neuroleptics the displacing effect of cerulein, an analog of cholecystokinin octapeptide, was replaced by the stimulant action on 3H-spiroperidol binding.
It is assumed that increased interaction between 3H-spiroperidol and high affinity binding sites for apomorphine on dopamine2- and serotonin2-receptors underlies the antipsychotic action of neuroleptics after their prolonged administration.
Dual effect of ouabain on the palytoxin-induced contraction and norepinephrine release in the guinea-pig vas deferens.
Palytoxin (PTX), C129H223N3O54, isolated from marine coelenterates of Palythoa tuberculosa, caused a first rapid contraction followed by the slow phasic contraction of guinea-pig vas deferens.
In the presence of ouabain (10(-5) M), PTX (10(-8) M) failed to cause the first contraction;
When ouabain was applied to the muscle in the presence of phentolamine, both first and second contractile responses to PTX were abolished.
Exposure of the muscle to ouabain (10(-5) M) markedly increased the PTX-induced release.
The second response is due to a release of norepinephrine from nerves and was potentiated by ouabain through the increase in the norepinephrine release, whereas the first response was not due to the norepinephrine release but presumably to a direct action on smooth muscle cell and was inhibited by ouabain.
[Quantitative approach to treatment with incisive neuroleptics by therapeutic monitoring]; The problems encountered during the longterm treatment of psychotic patients with neuroleptics are illustrated by six typical case reports.
The intestinal absorption of arsenate(As(V)) has been investigated in the chick by means of the in situ ligated duodenal loop technique.
By this procedure, it was observed that arsenate is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed (80-95%) from the lumen at As(V) concentrations up to 5 mM, declining to about 50% absorption at 50 mM.
At stable As(V) concentrations greater than 1 mM, fractional mucosal cell accumulation of As(V) remains constant, while fractional transfer to the body declines.
However, total mucosal accumulation of As(V) and that transferred to the body increase in a linear logarithmic fashion from 0.05 to 5 mm As(V).
Furthermore, arsenate and phosphate do not appear to share a common transport pathway in the duodenum and no evidence was obtained for any interaction between the two at this level.
Vitamin D3 administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal arsenate absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
By contrast, spermidine (1 mM) and putrescine (1 mM) had no significant effect on the translocation when added alone.
Spermine, and to a lesser extent, spermidine, enhanced the translocating action of oleate and increased its effectiveness in transferring the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction.
Slow-channel calcium blockers, such as verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine, inhibit platelet activation in vitro, and decrease platelet adhesion intravascularly.
Differential actions of intrathecal naloxone on blocking the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin and morphine in rats.
The blockade of the spinal endorphinergic system by intrathecal naloxone on the production of tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin and morphine was then studied.
Intraventricular injection of beta-endorphin and morphine produced an inhibition of the tail-flick response to the heat stimulus in rats.
Intrathecal injection of naloxone at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of beta-endorphin, and a high dose of naloxone (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin (16 micrograms).
On the other hand, intrathecal naloxone (12-120 micrograms) had only a very weak effect on the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular morphine (40 micrograms).
Intraventricular injection of naloxone at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin and morphine.
The results indicate that a spinal naloxone-sensitive endorphinergic system is involved in the production of beta-endorphin but not morphine-induced tail-flick inhibition, and suggest that intraventricular beta-endorphin and morphine elicit their pharmacological actions via the activation of different descending pain inhibitory systems;
descending epsilon and mu systems for beta-endorphin and morphine, respectively, are proposed.
Neurochemical and functional consequences following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and methamphetamine.
The neurochemical and functional consequences following MPTP administration to the rat were evaluated and compared to similar effects following methamphetamine administration.
It was observed that MPTP induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by pargyline pretreatment.
The MPTP-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of apomorphine in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
Methamphetamine, like MPTP, produced depletions of striatal dopamine but these actions were potentiated by pargyline pretreatment.
Dexamethasone and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate EGF- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
Prostatic epithelium proliferates in a defined medium consisting of basal medium RPMI1640 containing transferrin (1 microgram/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), and insulin (3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 IU/ml).
Although neither dexamethasone nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and insulin.
Dexamethasone at 10(-10) M or retinyl acetate at about 3 X 10(-9) M inhibits proliferation stimulated by EGF.
Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of EGF.
Dexamethasone had a similar effect in the presence of insulin.
However, retinyl acetate stimulated, but did not significantly inhibit, proliferation in the presence of insulin.
These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and EGF.
For the calcium-entry blocking agents now available in the United States (verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem), these data appeared well after clinical patterns of use evolved.
by the nonlinear kinetic characteristics for verapamil and diltiazem (and probably for nifedipine, as well) and the derivative implications for decreased dosing frequency requirements;
Selective survival in pentazocine and tripelennamine of Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11 from drug addicts.
The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly serotype O11, in pentazocine and tripelennamine
Twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus (a frequent cause of infection in heroin, but not in pentazocine and tripelennamine, addicts) were completely inhibited by the drug combination.
Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that tripelennamine was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by pentazocine.
aureus, to survive in pentazocine and tripelennamine may explain in part a shift from S.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the digoxin-amiodarone interaction.
Amiodarone is known to raise serum digoxin levels.
The pharmacokinetic variables for digoxin were determined after a 1.0 mg intravenous dose of digoxin in each subject, before and after oral amiodarone, 400 mg daily for 3 weeks.
During amiodarone administration, systemic clearance of digoxin was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
Amiodarone caused a three- to fivefold increase in serum reverse triiodothyronine levels, but changes in thyroid function were not quantitatively related to the changes in digoxin pharmacokinetics.
These alterations in digoxin pharmacokinetics produced by amiodarone explain the increase in serum digoxin level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically.
Misonidazole protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral CCNU.
Because the nitrosourea CCNU is given exclusively by the oral route in man, we have carried out studies in mice on the antitumour activity, acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral CCNU, either alone or in combination with the chemosensitizer misonidazole.
Misonidazole reduced the antitumour activity of oral CCNU by dose modifying factors (DMF) of 0.58-0.71.
Misonidazole has a complex effect on oral CCNU pharmacokinetics.
We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral CCNU cytotoxicity by misonidazole.
Enhanced theophylline clearance secondary to phenytoin therapy.
This report describes two cases in which theophylline clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant phenytoin administration.
With combined use, clinicians should be aware, when phenytoin is added, of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum theophylline concentrations.
The behavioral effects of the stereoisomers of N-allylnormetazocine (NANM) were compared with those of phencyclidine (PCP) in pigeons and squirrel monkeys responding under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio (FI FR) schedule of food presentation.
Intermediate doses of (+)-NANM or PCP produced transient increases in FI responding in monkeys and sustained increases in FI responding in pigeons;
In monkeys, (-)-NANM was about 10 times more potent than (+)-NANM in decreasing responding, whereas in pigeons (-)-NANM was about equipotent with (+)-NANM.
In both species, (-)-NANM, but not (+)-NANM, antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of morphine on FI and FR responding.
In monkeys, the effects of (-)-NANM, but not (+)-NANM or PCP, were antagonized by naloxone;
the doses of naloxone required to antagonize the effects of (-)-NANM were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of morphine.
In pigeons, naloxone did not systematically alter the effects of (-)-NANM, (+)-NANM or PCP.
Haloperidol reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either (+)-NANM or PCP in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
Increased hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen by concomitant administration of caffeine in the rat.
Since caffeine is frequently co-administered with acetaminophen, it is of clinical interest to study the effect of caffeine on the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen.
Careful observations on hepatotoxicity are suggested when acetaminophen is prescribed with caffeine.
High-dose cisplatin with sodium thiosulfate protection.
Sodium thiosulfate is a neutralizing agent for cisplatin that protects against renal damage.
To determine whether injection of thiosulfate would permit larger doses of cisplatin to be administered, a fixed 9.9-g/m2 dose of thiosulfate was given intravenously over three hours concurrently with escalating doses of cisplatin.
Cisplatin was administered over the last two hours of the thiosulfate infusion.
Comparison of cisplatin pharmacokinetics in patients treated with 202.5 mg/m2 plus thiosulfate to those in patients treated with 100 mg/m2 without thiosulfate indicated that there were no changes in the elimination rate constant, volume of distribution, or total body clearance of cisplatin.
This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of thiosulfate permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to cisplatin.
Failure of neomycin to modify ACTH induced hypertension in sheep.
Studies in rats have shown that neomycin administration attenuates certain types of adrenocortical steroid dependent hypertension, including ACTH hypertension.
The effects of oral neomycin on ACTH induced hypertension were examined in conscious sheep.
Neomycin has no effect on the blood pressure or metabolic responses to ACTH in sheep.
Changes in urinary homocysteine following synthetic steroidal estrogen and progestogen administration to rats.
The present work involved the administration of both ethynyl estradiol and levonorgestrel to groups of rats, followed by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine.
The results indicate that a statistically significant difference exists between the excreted levels of homocysteine in the urine of both control and levonorgestrel-treated rats and the levels shown by rats treated with ethynyl estradiol.
Thirty male rats of the Fischer-344 strain were divided into three equal groups and were given injections of trimethyl lead (TML) (8.0 or 17.0 mg/kg/ml SC) or the saline vehicle.
The 20% v/v solution of alcohol was prepared in water from a stock solution of 95% ethanol.
These results suggest that exposure to environmental lead may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to alcohol.
Since photic evoked potential components are representations of neural pathways which are activated during photic stimulation, study of the effects of alcohol on these components may help to trace pathways which are affected by alcohol.
In the present study, evoked potentials were recorded at 5, 20, and 40 min following IP injections of saline, ethanol (2.0 g/kg), physostigmine (0.6 mg/kg) or atropine (15.0 mg/kg) on separate days.
Physostigmine pretreatment augmented the depressant effect of alcohol on the early components P1 and N1, while attenuating alcohol's influence on components P2 and P3.
Atropine, either alone or in combination with alcohol, produced approximately the same degree of enhancement of component P2.
Hypothermia as an index of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction in the rat.
Decreased core temperature in female rats was investigated as one possible index of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER).
Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when ethanol was administered to rats treated with disulfiram 8 hours before the ethanol challenge.
The decrease in temperature began within 20 minutes after ethanol administration, reaching a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minutes post ethanol.
Maximal hypotension was found 120 minutes post ethanol, and returned to normal 300 minutes after ethanol.
Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between neurotensin and enkephalins or tuftsin.
The aim of this paper was to study the interaction between neurotensin and both enkephalins or its synthetic analogue D-Ala2-metenkephalinamide, or tuftsin, on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptides in mice after intracisternal injection.
It was shown that neurotensin antagonized evidently the antinociceptive effect of enkephalins and their analogue.
On the contrary, neurotensin and tuftsin were agonists in induction of analgesia.
It is concluded that neurotensin modulates in an opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neurons and the central action of tuftsin.
Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of thiabendazole to treat strongyloidiasis during the melarsoprol cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients.
Recommendations were to avoid administration of diffusible anti-helminthic treatment during the cure, and to improve the general conditions of patients before the cure of melarsoprol.
Interactions of cobalt and iron in absorption and retention.
The effects of supplementary oral cobalt and iron, as well as the interaction between both at the absorption site, fecal and urinary excretion as well as the retention of these trace elements were determined by using four diets containing either 9 or 63 micrograms/kg of Co and 48 or 446 mg/kg of Fe over a period of 19 days in a total of 24 rats.
Cobalt excretion was enhanced by supplementary cobalt;
Additional iron significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary cobalt treatments.
The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg Fe instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of cobalt.
Consequently, the effect of iron on the retention of cobalt was lower than on absorption.
Because of the low dietary cobalt concentration as compared to the iron contents of the diets, no effect of cobalt on iron absorption and excretion occurred.
Differences in iron balance were only observed between both dietary concentrations, showing a higher absolute but a lower relative absorption as well as retention in the groups fed further Fe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Effect of estradiol on endotoxin-induced changes in steroid hormone levels and lethality in male rats.
We examined the effect of exogenous estradiol on the changes in serum steroid hormone levels induced by a nonlethal dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin in male rats and the deaths due to nonlethal and lethal doses of endotoxin.
Injection of estradiol 5 min before a nonlethal dose of endotoxin changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to endotoxin.
The serum estrogen concentrations of estradiol + endotoxin-treated rats decreased by 50%, while those of the endotoxin-treated rats increased (2- to 5-fold).
The serum androgen concentrations of estradiol + endotoxin-treated rats did not change significantly, while those of endotoxin-treated rats dropped to 30-40%
Exogenous estradiol also appeared to influence the percentage of endotoxin-induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner.
These results, together with the known relationships between estrogen and the immune response, suggest that estrogens affect the course of septic shock in a complex fashion and may have either protective or deleterious effect.
The 16,16-dimethylprostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2)-induced diarrhea was analyzed in cecectomized rats prepared by resecting the cecum and its vasculature without disturbing the ileocecal junction.
On the other hand, the enhanced secretion of colonic fluid by dmPGE2, given intraluminally, was only half of that in control rats, whereas the colonic transit-enhancing effect of dmPGE2 in cecectomized rats was more pronounced than in control rats at 15 but not at 30 min after its administration.
Loperamide and morphine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.)
Loperamide and morphine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited the dmPGE2 (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats.
N-methyllevallorphan (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of loperamide and partly antagonized the effect of morphine.
Therapeutic drug monitoring can avoid iatrogenic alterations caused by 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP)-gentamicin interaction.
Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms, but it is potentially toxic to the kidneys.
Due to its nephrotoxicity, gentamicin may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy.
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of gentamicin therapy, and bone scintigraphy employing 99mTc-MDP as the radiopharmaceutical was carried out in 22 patients.
The data presented here demonstrate that with serial pharmacokinetic dosing of gentamicin, the iatrogenic alteration caused by gentamicin therapy can be avoided.
This article looks at five commonly used immunosuppressive drugs in turn (corticosteroids, cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide), discussing the main, non-infection, unwanted effects, ways to avoid them and what to do if problems arise.
Little has been studied of the adverse effects of the exposure of the liver to the interaction of ethanol with its congeners and acetaldehyde, coexisting in the contents of alcoholic beverages.
Two groups (SH/DA; SH/FA) were submitted to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solutions containing ethanol, methanol, higher alcohols and acetaldehyde in the same proportions as those found in most common distilled and fermented alcoholic beverages;
These results suggest that the hepatoxicity of ethanol in alcoholic beverages is enhanced by interaction with its congeners and acetaldehyde;
Induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to vitamin D and antiestrogens.
1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active metabolite of vitamin D, is a potent inhibitor of breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro.
In the experiments reported here, we examined the interactions between 1,25(OH)2D3 and the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TAM), which also induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.
Our data suggest that TAM significantly potentiates the reduction in cell number induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 alone.
Combined treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 and TAM enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation.
These data emphasize that apoptosis can be induced in MCF-7 cells either by activation of vitamin-D-mediated signalling or disruption of estrogen-dependent signalling.
We investigated the effects of adenosine receptor antagonists, caffeine, theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), in a light/dark test in mice.
The anxiogenic effects of theophylline were reduced by pretreatment with CGS 21680, an A2-selective agonist, but not by N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), an A1-selective agonist.
However, the antagonism of the theophylline-induced anxiogenic effects by CGS21680 was only observed in the time spent in the light zone, and DPCPX-induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by CGS 21680 nor by CPA.
[The effect of sandimmune on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidases in the liver microsomes]
[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]
The higher verografine and iodamide excretion was due to their increased renal tubular secretion.
In dogs, cimetidine unchanged the secretion of cardiotrast, a test agent for anionic transport.
Possible extrarenal mechanisms of action of cimetidine on verografine and iodamide transport were also examined.
Two different types of therapy with magnesium are used: physiological oral magnesium supplementation which is totally atoxic since it palliates magnesium deficiencies by simply normalizing the magnesium intake and pharmacological magnesium therapy which may induce toxicity since it creates iatrogenic magnesium overload.
Primary and secondary magnesium deficiencies constitute the sole indication of physiological oral magnesium therapy.
It is therefore necessary to be well acquainted with the clinical and paraclinical pattern of magnesium deficit and to discriminate between magnesium deficiency due to an insufficient magnesium intake which only requires oral physiological supplementation and magnesium depletion related to a dysregulation of the control mechanisms of magnesium status which requires more or less specific regulation of its causal dysregulation.
Physiological oral magnesium load constitutes the best tool for diagnosis of magnesium deficiency and the first step of its treatment.
Physiological oral magnesium supplementation (5 mg/kg/day) is easy and can be carried out in the diet or with magnesium salts, with practically only one contra-indication: overt renal failure.
Specific and aspecific treatments of magnesium depletion are tricky using for example magnesium sparing diuretics, pharmacological doses of vitamin B6, physiological doses of vitamin D and of selenium.
There are 3 types of indications: specific (for the treatment of some forms of magnesium deficit i.e. acute), pharmacological (i.e. without alterations of magnesium status) and mixed--pharmacological and aetiopathogenic--(for example complications of chronic alcoholism).
Lastly local use of the mucocutaneous and cytoprotective properties of magnesium is still valid, in cardioplegic solutions and for preservation of transplants particularly.
Interaction between glycine and glutamate in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos.
The successive application of glycine (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and glutamate (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone.
The EC50 values for isoproterenol, which is not a substrate for norepinephrine uptake-1, were reduced in myocardium in functional classes II to III and IV compared with those in nonfailing myocardium.
The uptake inhibitors cocaine and desipramine (3 mumol/liter) potentiated the positive inotropic effects of norepinephrine in nonfailing myocardium (p < 0.05) but not in functional class IV myocardium.
Radioligand binding experiments using the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 mazindol revealed a significant decrease by approximately 30% in norepinephrine uptake-1 carrier density in functional classes II to III and IV myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium (p < 0.05).
This defect in the failing heart can be mimicked by the effects of uptake blocking agents, such as cocaine and desipramine, in the nonfailing heart only.
Compromised norepinephrine uptake-1 in functional class IV cannot be further increased by cocaine and desipramine.
[A pharmacological analysis of the effect of angiotensin on stimulated gastric secretion]
It was established that both angiotensins inhibited gastric acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin but not by histamine.
Comparative analysis of the effects of stimulation and inhibition of cholino- and adrenoreceptors on this inhibitory action of angiotensins suggested the mediation of angiotensin influence through the modulation of cholinergic reactions of parietal cells in the stomach.
Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine;
Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level.
Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin.
Cyclosporin: After introduction of chloroquine (oral form), a sudden increase in serum cyclosporin level has been reported.
Therefore, close monitoring of serum cyclosporin level is recommended and, if necessary, chloroquine should be discontinued.
- Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of otthostatic hypotension may occur
- Antidiabetic drugs: (Oral agents and insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required
- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and colestipol resins have the potential of binding thiazide diuretics and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
- Corticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia
- Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine): Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant
- Lithium: Generally should not be given with diuretics.
Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with chlorothiazide
- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.
Therefore, when chlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
Chlorotrianisene may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
Increased toxicity (CNS depression): CNS depressants, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines.
Example inhibitors include azole antifungals, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, erythromycin, imatinib, isoniazid, nefazodone, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, and verapamil.
The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
Interactions may also occur with the following: anti-depressants/anti-anxiety drugs, drugs used to treat an overactive thyroid, beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol), sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, guanethidine, guanadrel, metrizamide, cabergoline, lithium, narcotic pain medication (e.g., codeine), drugs used to aid sleep, drowsiness-causing antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), any other drugs that may make you drowsy.
The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylurea may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
Since animal studies suggest that the action of barbiturates may be prolonged by therapy with chlorpropamide, barbiturates should be employed with caution.
In some patients, a disulfiram-like reaction may be produced by the ingestion of alcohol.
A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.
Chlorprothixene may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given lithium.
In order to avoid lithium intoxication, lithium plasma levels should be monitored closely.
If chlorprothixene is given concomitantly with opioids, the opioid dose should be reduced (by approx. 50%), because chlorprothixene amplifies the therapeutic actions and side-effects of opioids massively.
Avoid the concomitant use of chlorprothixene and tramadol (Ultram).
Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if chlorprothixene is given with benzodiazepines or barbituates.
Exert particular caution in combining chlorprothixene with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
Chlorthalidone may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs.
Chlorthalidone and related drugs may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine.
Chlorthalidone and related drugs may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine.
The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may have an additive effect.
Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of fat soluble vitamins;
Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of calcitriol/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
Since blood level of calcitriol/ergocalcitriol will be reduced, higher doses of Rocaltrol may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously.
Thiazides: Thiazides are known to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine.
Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of thiazides with vitamin D causes hypercalcemia.
Digitalis: Vitamin D dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with digitalis, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of vitamin D.
However, in vivo drug interaction studies of ketoconazole with vitamin D have not been investigated.
Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between vitamin D analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and corticosteroids, which inhibit calcium absorption.
Vitamin D: The coadministration of any of the vitamin D analogues should be avoided as this could create possible additive effects and hypercalcemia.
Calcium Supplements: Uncontrolled intake of additional calcium-containing preparations should be avoided.
Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with vitamin D by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
Cholestyramine resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
Cholestyramine resin may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo enterohepatic circulation, The discontinuance of cholestyramine resin could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug such as digitalis has been filtrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking cholestyramine resin.
Because cholestyramine binds bile acids, cholestyramine resin may interfere with normal fat digestion and absorption and thus may prevent absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K.
When cholestyramine resin is given for long periods of time, concomitant supplementation with water-miscible (or parenteral) forms of fat-soluble vitamins should be considered.
SINCE CHOLESTYRAMINE RESIN MAY BIND OTHER DRUGS GIVEN CONCURRENTLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PATIENTS TAKE OTHER DRUGS AT LEAST 1 HOUR BEFORE OR 4 TO 6 HOURS AFTER CHOLESTYRAMINE RESIN (OR AT AS GREAT AN INTERVAL AS POSSIBLE) TO AVOID IMPEDING THEIR ABSORPTION.
In vitro studies demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of des-ciclesonide was not affected by warfarin or salicylic acid, indicating no potential for protein binding-based drug interactions.
In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral erythromycin, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either des-ciclesonide or erythromycin.
In another drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of des-ciclesonide by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged.
Therefore, ketoconazole should be administered with caution with intranasal ciclesonide.
Probenecid : Probenecid is known to interact with the metabolism or renal tubular excretion of many drugs (e.g., acetaminophen, acyclovir, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aminosalicylic acid, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, bumetanide, clofibrate, methotrexate, famotidine, furosemide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, theophylline, and zidovudine).
Zidovudine should either be temporarily discontinued or decreased by 50% when coadministered with probenecid on the day of VISTIDE infusion.
Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of VISTIDE and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
Since PLETAL is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, caution should be exercised when PLETAL is coadministered with inhibitors of C.P.A. such as ketoconazole and erythromycin or inhibitors of CYP2C19 such as omeprazole.
Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that omeprazole and erythromycin significantly increased the systemic exposure of cilostazol and/or its major metabolites.
Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of cilostazol among patients concurrently treated with diltiazem, an inhibitor of C.P.A..
Pletal does not, however, appear to cause increased blood levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, as it had no effect on lovastatin, a drug with metabolism very sensitive to C.P.A. inhibition.
Tagamet, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when Tagamet is administered concomitantly.
Interaction with phenytoin, lidocaine and theophylline has also been reported to produce adverse clinical effects.
However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either Tagamet 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of theophylline (Theo-Dur , Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older.
Effect of Sensipar on other drugs: Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6): Sensipar  is a strong in vitro inhibitor of CYP2D6.
Therefore, dose adjustments of concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., flecainide, vinblastine, thioridazine and most tricyclic antidepressants) may be required.
Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg cinacalcet with 50 mg amitriptyline increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
Effect of other drugs on Sensipar : Sensipar  is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2.
Ketoconazole: Sensipar is metabolized in part by CYP3A4.
Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased cinacalcet exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold.
Dose adjustment of Sensipar may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, itraconazole;
Elevated plasma levels of theophylline have been reported with concomitant use of some quinolones.
There have been reports of theophylline-related side-effects in patients on concomitant theophylline-quinolone therapy.
Therefore, monitoring of theophylline plasma levels should be considered and dosage of theophylline adjusted as required.
Quinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine.
Although this interaction has not been reported with cinoxacin, caution should be exercised when cinoxacin is given concomitantly with caffeine-containing products.
Antacids or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some quinolones, resulting in low urine levels.
Also, concomitant administration of quinolones with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
Quinolones, including cinoxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
Seizures have been reported in patients taking another quinolone class antimicrobial and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug fenbufen concurrently.
Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when cinoxacin and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are administered concomitantly.
Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of quinolones and cyclosporine.
Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine.
Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly.
Glyburide: The concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with the sulfonylurea glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.
Histamine H2-receptor antagonists: Histamine H2-receptor antagonists appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin.
Methotrexate Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate.
Therefore, patients under methotrexate therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant ciprofloxacin therapy is indicated.
Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
This time window is different than for other oral formulations of ciprofloxacin, which are usually administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (but not aspirin): These drugs in combination with very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies.
Omeprazole: The rate and extent of absorption of ciprofloxacin was bioequivalent when Proquin XR was given alone or when Proquin XR was given 2 hours after omeprazole at the dose that maximally suppresses gastric acid secretion.
Omeprazole should be taken as directed and Proquin XR should be taken with a main meal of the day, preferably the evening meal..
Phenytoin: Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin.
Probenecid: Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.
Theophylline: As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life.
Warfarin: Quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant warfarin or its derivatives.
In some cases where serious ventricular arrhythmias, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes have occurred when cisapride was taken in conjunction with one of the cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, elevated blood cisapride levels were noted at the time of the QT prolongation.
Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, erythromycin, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of cisapride, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
Anticholinergics: Concurrent administration of certain anticholinergic compounds, such as belladonna alkaloids and dicyclomine, would be expected to compromise the beneficial effects of cisapride.
Anticoagulants (Oral): In patients receiving oral anticoagulants, the coagulation times were increased in some cases.
It is advisable to check coagulation time within the first few days after the start and discontinuation of cisapride therapy, with an appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dose, if necessary.
Antidepressants: In vitro data indicate that nefazodone inhibits the metabolism of cisapride, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of cisapride, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of cisapride, resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
A study in 14 normal male and female volunteers suggests that coadministration of cisapride and ketoconazole can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
H2 Receptor Antagonists: Cimetidine coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and AUC of cisapride, there is no effect on cisapride absorption when it is coadministered with ranitidine.
The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with cisapride.
Protease Inhibitors: In vitro data indicate that indinavir and ritonavir markedly inhibit the metabolism of cisapride which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
Other: Coadministration of grapefruit juice with cisapride increases the bioavailability of cisapride and concomitant use should be avoided.
Cisapride should not be used concomitantly with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval: certain antiarrhythmics, including those of Class IA (such as quinidine and procainamide) and Class III (such as sotalol);
tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline);
certain tetracyclic antidepressants (such as maprotiline);
certain antipsychotic medications (such as sertindole);
astemizole, bepridil, sparfloxacin, and terodiline.
Administration of 0.1-mg/kg (2 x ED95) NIMBEX at 10% or 95% recovery following an intubating dose of succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) produced  95% neuromuscular block.
The time to onset of maximum block following NIMBEX is approximately 2 minutes faster with prior administration of succinylcholine.
Prior administration of succinylcholine had no effect on the duration of neuromuscular block following initial or maintenance bolus doses of NIMBEX.
Infusion requirements of NIMBEX in patients administered succinylcholine prior to infusions of NIMBEX were comparable to or slightly greater than when succinylcholine was not administered.
The use of NIMBEX before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied.
Although not studied systematically in clinical trials, no drug interactions were observed when vecuronium, pancuronium, or atracurium were administered following varying degrees of recovery from single doses or infusions of NIMBEX.
Isoflurane or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
Fifteen to 30 minutes of exposure to 1.25 MAC isoflurane or enflurane had minimal effects on the duration of action of initial doses of NIMBEX and therefore, no adjustment to the initial dose should be necessary when NIMBEX is administered shortly after initiation of volatile agents.
In long surgical procedures during enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of NIMBEX may be necessary.
In clinical studies propofol had no effect on the duration of action or dosing requirements for NIMBEX.
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine.
While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of NIMBEX are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher.
Plasma levels of anticonvulsant agents may become subtherapeutic during cisplatin therapy.
Central nervous system depressant (CNS) drugs including alcohol, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, blood pressure medications (reserpine, methyldopa, beta-blockers), motion sickness medications, muscle relaxants, narcotics, sedatives, sleeping pills and tranquilizers
The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone.
It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.
In controlled clinical trials of AUGMENTIN XR, 22 patients received concomitant allopurinol and AUGMENTIN XR.
However, this sample size is too small to allow for any conclusions to be drawn regarding the risk of rashes with concomitant AUGMENTIN XR and allopurinol use.
In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, AUGMENTIN XR may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives
Additive CNS depression may occur when antihistamines are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol.
Patients receiving antihistamines should be advised against the concurrent use of other CNS depressant drugs.
Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines.
Amantadine, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of clidinium.
Clidinium may decrease the effect of phenothiazines, levodopa, and ketoconazole.
Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents.
Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin in vitro.
Alcohol (increases bioavailability by 50%), cimetidine, and valproates.
Preliminary data which suggest that dapsone may inhibit the anti-inflammatory activity of Lamprene have not been confirmed.
If leprosy-associated inflammatory reactions develop in patients being treated with dapsone and clofazimine, it is still advisable to continue treatment with both drugs.
Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with Atromid-S.
Atromid-S may displace acidic drugs such as phenytoin or tolbutamide from their binding sites.
The hypoglycemic effect of tolbutamide has been reported to increase when Atromid-S is given concurrently.
Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another fibrate and lovastatin but may be seen after several months.
For these reasons, it is felt that, in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the possible benefits of combined therapy with lovastatin and a fibrate do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.
While it is not known whether this interaction occurs with fibrates other than gemfibrozil, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occasionally been associated with the use of fibrates alone, including clofibrate.
Therefore, the combined use of lovastatin with fibrates should generally be avoided.
Anafranil should not be used with MAO inhibitors.
Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when Anafranil is administered with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.
Several tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to block the pharmacologic effects of guanethidine, clonidine, or similar agents, and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI because of its structural similarity to other tricyclic antidepressants.
The plasma concentration of CMI has been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of haloperidol;
plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
Administration of CMI has been reported to increase the plasma levels of phenobarbital, if given concomitantly.
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected lasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.
cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide).
While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.
Fluvoxamine has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in TCAmetabolism.
The extent to which SSRI-TCAinteractions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other.
Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCAtreatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).
Concomitant use of agents in the tricyclic antidepressant class (which includes Anafranil) with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant agent or the other drug.
It is desirable to monitor TCAplasma levels whenever an agent of the tricyclic antidepressant class including Anafranil is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 (and/or P450 1A2).
Because Anafranil is highly bound to serum protein, the administration of Anafranil to patients taking other drugs that are highly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digoxin) may cause an increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital.
Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Clonazepam: Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics.
In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
Fluoxetine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam.
Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.
Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents, should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam.
Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs.
Tablet If a patient receiving clonidine hydrochloride is also taking tricyclic antidepressants, the effect of clonidine may be reduced, thus necessitating an increase in dosage.
Clonidine hydrochloride may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedatives.
Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs.
Narcotic analgesics may potentiate the hypotensive effects of clonidine.
Tricyclic antidepressants may antagonize the hypotensive effects of clonidine.
The effects of tricyclic antidepressants on clonidines analgesic actions are not known.
Beta blockers may exacerbate the hypertensive response seen with clonidine withdrawl.
Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving clonidine with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of fluphenazine and oral clonidine.
Symptoms resolved when clonidine was withdrawn and recurred when the patient was rechallenged with clonidine.
Epidural clonidine may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local anesthetics, including both sensory and motor blockade.
Aspirin, warfarin, heparin, NSAIDs
Animal experience indicates that clorazepate dipotassium prolongs the sleeping time after hexobarbital or after ethyl alcohol, increases the inhibitory effects of chlorpromazine, but does not exhibit monoamine oxidase inhibition.
The actions of the benzodiazepines may be potentiated by barbiturates, narcotics, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or other antidepressants.
In bioavailability studies with normal subjects, the concurrent administration of antacids at therapeutic levels did not significantly influence the bioavailability of TRANXENE tablets.
Given the primary CNS effects of Clozapine, caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs or alcohol.
similar events have been reported in patients taking other psychotropic drugs or even Clozapine by itself.
Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when clozapine is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other psychotropic drug.
Clozapine may potentiate the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive drugs and the anticholinergic effects of atropine-type drugs.
The administration of epinephrine should be avoided in the treatment of drug induced hypotension because of a possible reverse epinephrine effect.
Phenytoin, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease Clozapine plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
Cimetidine, caffeine, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of Clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
In a study of schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady state conditions, fluvoxamine or paroxetine was added in 16 and 14 patients, respectively.
After 14 days of co-administration, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide, were elevated with fluvoxamine by about three-fold compared to baseline concentrations.
Paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites.
However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
Therefore, such combined treatment should be approached with caution and patients should be monitored closely when Clozapine is combined with these drugs, particularly with fluvoxamine.
Such individuals are referred to as poor metabolizers of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, the tricyclic antidepressants, and clozapine.
In addition, certain drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including many antidepressants (clozapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isozyme, and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system, leading to drug interaction.
Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either clozapine or the other drug.
Therefore, co-administration of clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
The risk of a potential interaction between NovoSeven and coagulation factor concentrates has not been adequately evaluated in preclinical or clinical studies.
Simultaneous use of activated prothrombin complex concentrates or prothrombin complex concentrates should be avoided.
Although the specific drug interaction was not studied in a clinical trial, there have been more than 50 episodes of concomitant use of antifibrinolytic therapies (i.e., tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) and NovoSeven.
Codeine in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
Colchicine is inhibited by acidifying agents.
The action of colchicine is potentiated by alkalinizing agents.
Colchicine may increase sensitivity to the CNS depressants.
Response to sympathomimetic agents may be enhanced by colchicine.
WelChol  was found to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, lovastatin, metoprolol, quinidine, valproic acid, and warfarin.
WelChol  decreased the Cmax and AUC of sustained-release verapamil (Calan SR ) by approximately 31% and 11%, respectively.
In clinical studies, coadministration of WelChol  with atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin did not interfere with the lipid-lowering activity of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
Since colestipol hydrochloride is an anion exchange resin, it may have a strong affinity for anions other than the bile acids.
Repeated doses of colestipol hydrochloride given prior to a single dose of propranolol in human trials have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption.
However, in a follow-up study in normal subjects, single-dose administration of colestipol hydrochloride and propranolol and twice-a-day administration for 5 days of both agents did not affect the extent of propranolol absorption, but had a small yet statistically significant effect on its rate of absorption;
Therefore, patients on propranolol should be observed when COLESTID Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
Studies in humans show that the absorption of chlorothiazide as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before colestipol hydrochloride.
The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with colestipol hydrochloride;
No depressant effect on blood levels in humans was noted when colestipol hydrochloride was administered with any of the following drugs: aspirin, clindamycin, clofibrate, methyldopa, nicotinic acid (niacin), tolbutamide, phenytoin or warfarin.
Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of colestipol hydrochloride on the availability of digoxin and digitoxin.
Discontinuing colestipol hydrochloride could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug that is significantly bound to the resin has been titrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking colestipol hydrochloride.
Bile acid binding resins may also interfere with the absorption of oral phosphate supplements and hydrocortisone.
Certain other antibiotics (aminoglycosides and polymyxin) have also been reported to interfere with the nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction.
Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with Coly-Mycin M Parenteral.
Sodium cephalothin may enhance the nephrotoxicity of Coly-Mycin M Parenteral.
The concomitant use of sodium cephalothin and Coly-Mycin M Parenteral should be avoided.
Digoxin: Coadministration of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate, with oral conivaptan resulted in a reduction in clearance and an increase in digoxin Cmax and AUC values.
Therefore, if digoxin is administered with VAPRISOL, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increases in digoxin levels.
decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity;
increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity;
Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, (i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively.
Corticotropin may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with diuretic therapy.
Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response.
Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance.
Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin.
This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn.
Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with cortico-steroids in patients suffering from hypopro-thrombinemia.
The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable.
There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulants when given concurrently with corticosteroids.
Corticotropin may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with diuretic therapy.
Drug Interaction During Pregnancy: Cromolyn sodium and isoproterenol were studied following subcutaneous injections in pregnant mice.
The addition of 540 mg/kg/day of cromolyn sodium (approximately 340 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) to 2.7 mg/kg/day of isoproterenol (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations.
Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12 diagnostic blood assays.
Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12.
FLEXERIL may have life-threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors.
FLEXERIL may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.
Tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds.
Tricyclic antidepressants may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking tramadol
Cyclopentolate may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of carbachol or pilocarpine;
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide reportedly are increased by chronic administration of high doses of phenobarbital.
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving cyclophosphamide even though cyclophosphamide has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs.
Cyclophosphamide treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of succinylcholine chloride.
May interact with wthionamide (Trecator-SC) and isoniazid (Nydrazid).
MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines.
Antihistamines may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
Drug/LaboratoryTest Interactions Dactinomycin may interfere with bioassay procedures for the determination of antibacterial drug levels.
However, neither phenobarbital nor diazepam appears to affect Dantrium metabolism.
Binding to plasma protein is not significantly altered by diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, or phenylbutazone.
Binding to plasma proteins is reduced by warfarin and clotibrate and increased by tolbutamide.
The combination of therapeutic doses of intravenous dantrolene sodium and verapamil in halothane a-chloralose anesthetized swine has resulted in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia.
It is recommended that the combination of intravenous dantrolene sodium and calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, not be used together during the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis until the relevance of these findings to humans is established.
Administration of dantrolene may potentiate vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block.
A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of ACZONE Gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).
During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged.
Notably, systemic exposure (AUC0-12) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX.
Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX.
Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St.
John s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis.
With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions
Warfarin: Concomitant administration of daptomycin (6 mg/kg once every 24 hours for 5 days) and warfarin (25 mg single oral dose) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug, and the INR was not significantly altered.
HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may cause myopathy, which is manifested as muscle pain or weakness associated with elevated levels of CPK.
There were no reports of skeletal myopathy in a placebo-controlled Phase I trial in which 10 healthy subjects on stable simvastatin therapy were treated concurrently with daptomycin (4 mg/kg once every 24 hours) for 14 days.
Experience with co-administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and Fentanyl in patients is limited,therefore,consideration should be given to temporarily suspending use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in patients receiving Fentanyl.
The daily dose of ENABLEX should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
Caution should be taken when ENABLEX is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
The concomitant use of ENABLEX with other anticholinergic agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
Drugs that may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate.
Concomitant use of SPRYCEL and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
In patients receiving treatment with SPRYCEL, close monitoring for toxicity and a SPRYCEL dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided.
Drugs that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers: Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations.
In patients in whom CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital) are indicated, alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be used.
If SPRYCEL must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer, a dose increase in SPRYCEL should be considered.
Antacids: Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent.
Simultaneous administration of SPRYCEL with antacids should be avoided.
If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL.
H2 Blockers/Proton Pump Inhibitors: Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (eg, famotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure.
The concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with SPRYCEL is not recommended.
The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving SPRYCEL therapy.
Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by dasatinib CYP3A4 Substrates: Dasatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.
Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving SPRYCEL.
Use of Cerubidine in a patient who has previously received doxorubicin increases the risk of cardiotoxicity.
Cerubidine should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or Cerubidine.
Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with Cerubidine may also result in increased cardiotoxicity.
Anticholinesterases (neostgmine, physostigmine), lignocaine, quinine, procainamide can enhance toxicity and cause cardio respiratory depression.
In addition, neuromuscular blocking action is enhanced by general anesthetics, local anesthetics like lidocaine, procaine, beta-blockers, metaclopramide, lithium carbonate, and terbutaline.
The concomitant administration of Exjade and aluminum-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied.
Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, Exjade should not be taken with aluminum-containing antacid preparations.
In healthy volunteers, Exjade had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
The effect of digoxin on Exjade pharmacokinetics has not been studied.
The concomitant administration of Exjade and vitamin C has not been formally studied.
The interaction of Exjade with hydroxyurea has not been formally studied.
No inhibition of deferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea is expected based on the results of an in vitro study.
Antiacid, clarithromycin, Didanosine, Fluconazole, Fluoxetine, Indanavir, Ketoconazole, Phenytoin, Phenobarbitol, carbamazepine, Rifabutin, Rifampin, Ritanovir, Saquinavir.
Possible drug interactions of HUMORSOL with succinylcholine or with other anticholinesterase agents.
Because the tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the tetracycline class of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillins, it is not advisable to administer these drugs concomitantly.
Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
Taking a rauwolfia alkaloid while you are taking or within 2 weeks of taking MAO inhibitors may increase the risk of central nervous system depression or may cause a severe high blood pressure reaction.
No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs, or drugs used during anesthesia (muscle relaxants, intravenous agents, and local anesthetic agents) were reported in clinical trials.
Like isoflurane, desflurane does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused epinephrine in swine.
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.
cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythrnics propatenone and flecainide).
While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, seriraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.
The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of T.A. with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other.
Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug.
It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.
Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when this drug is given concomitantly with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs.
If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the major tranquilizers are also additive to those of desipramine.
Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants.
Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants have been reported upon discontinuation of cimetidine which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant 6.
There have been greater than two-fold increases of previously stable plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants when fluoxetine has been administered in combination with these agents.
In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) a nd female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days.
In three separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23 day pretreatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days (n=18) under steady state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers.
Although increased plasma concentrations (C max and AUC 0-24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed , there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.
Table 1 Changes in Desloratadine and 3-Hydroxydesloratadine Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Male and Female Volunteers
Desloratadine 3-Hydroxydesloratadine
Although the pressor activity of Desmopressin is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of Desmopressin Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring.
A similar association, though less marked, has been suggested with barbiturates, phenyl-butazone, phenytoin sodium, carbamazepine and possibly with griseofulvin, ampicillin, and tetracyclines (72)
Aminoglutethimide: Aminoglutethimide may diminish adrenal suppression by corticosteroids.
Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents: When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia.
In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.
Antibiotics: Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.
Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.
If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.
Anticoagulants, oral: Co-administration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports.
Antidiabetics: Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.
Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.
Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently.
Digitalis glycosides: Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.
Ephedrine: Ephedrine may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.
Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.
Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.
Co-administration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration.
Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.
In addition, ketoconazole alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS): Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.
The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.
Phenytoin: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in phenytoin levels with dexamethasone co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.
Thalidomide: Co-administration with thalidomide should be employed cautiously, as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use.
Vaccines: Patients on corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response.
Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines.
Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible.
Dexbrompheniramine can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, dexfenfluramine should not be used concomitantly with a MAO inhibitor.
At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with dexfenfluramine.
At least 3 weeks should elapse between discontinuation of dexfenfluramine and initiation of treatment with a MAO inhibitor.
A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
Dexfenfluramine should not be administered with other serotoninergic agents.
Anesthetics/Sedatives/Hypnotics/Opioids: Co-administration of PRECEDEX with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects.
Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam.
No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam have been demonstrated.
However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with PRECEDEX, a reduction in dosage of PRECEDEX on the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.
Neuromuscular Blockers: In one study of 10 healthy volunteers, administration of PRECEDEX for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of 1 (one) ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude or neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.
ZINECARD does not influence the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin.
Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines.
Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
Adrenergic blockers: Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.
Alkalinizing agents: Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines.
Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
Antidepressants, tricyclic: Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents;
d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;
MAO inhibitors: MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism.
Antihistamines: Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.
Antihypertensives: Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.
Chlorpromazine: Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.
Ethosuximide: Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.
Haloperidol: Haloperidol blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.
Lithium carbonate: The stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.
Meperidine: Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine.
Methenamine therapy: Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.
Norepinephrine: Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.
Phenobarbital: Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital;
Phenytoin: Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin;
Propoxyphene: In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.
Veratrum alkaloids: Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum alkaloids.
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels.
Additive depressant effect when used with general anesthetics, sedatives, antianxiety drugs, hypnotics, alcohol, and other opiate analgesics.
May interact with thyroid medication (e.g., levothyroxine), iodine-containing products, antacids, H2-antagonists (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine), and proton pump inhibitors (e.g., lansoprazole, omeprazole).
Caution is advised in patients receiving concomitant high-dose aspirin and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy and coma have been rarely reported due to a possible drug interaction.
Aspirin: Concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not recommended because diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
Anticoagulants: While studies have not shown diclofenac to interact with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, caution should be exercised, nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs.
Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including diclofenac, and warfarin requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
Digoxin, Methotrexate, Cyclosporine: Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs.
Ingestion of diclofenac may increase serum concentrations of digoxin and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
Patients who begin taking diclofenac or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking digoxin, methotrexate, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
Lithium: Diclofenac decreases lithium renal clearance and increases lithium plasma levels.
In patients taking diclofenac and lithium concomitantly, lithium toxicity may develop.
Oral Hypoglycemics: Diclofenac does not alter glucose metabolism in normal subjects nor does it alter the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents.
There are rare reports, however, from marketing experiences, of changes in effects of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of diclofenac that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents.
A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that diclofenac may alter a diabetic patient s response to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.
Diuretics: Diclofenac and other NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of diuretics.
Other Drugs: In small groups of patients (7-10/interaction study), the concomitant administration of azathioprine, gold, chloroquine, D-penicillamine, prednisolone, doxycycline, or digitoxin did not significantly affect the peak levels and AUC values of diclofenac.
Phenobarbital toxicity has been reported to have occurred in a patient on chronic phenobarbital treatment following the initiation of diclofenac therapy.
Protein Binding In vitro, diclofenac interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole have no influence in vitro on the protein binding of diclofenac in human serum.
Tetracycline, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactercidal effect of penicillin and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs. amantadine antiarrhythmic agents of class (e.g. quinidine), antihistamines antipsychotic agents (e.g. phenothiazines), benzodiazepines.
MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity.
Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents.
Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin;
Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide.
Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
Neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with a history of neuropathy or neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine, and these patients may be at increased risk of neuropathy during VIDEX therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).
Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when allopurinol at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of VIDEX to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
The effects of allopurinol on didanosine pharmacokinetics in subjects with normal renal function are not known.
Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing magnesium or aluminum with VIDEX Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as ketoconazole and itraconazole should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with VIDEX.
Ganciclovir: Administration of VIDEX 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral ganciclovir was associated with a 111 (114)% increase in the steady-state AUC of didanosine (n = 12).
A 21 (17)% decrease in the steady-state AUC of ganciclovir was observed when VIDEX was administered 2 hours prior to ganciclovir, but not when the two drugs were administered simultaneously (n = 12).
Quinolone Antibiotics: VIDEX should be administered at least 2 hours after or 6 hours before dosing with ciprofloxacin because plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or aluminum.
In eight HIV-infected patients, the steady-state AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 26% (95% CI = 14%, 37%) when ciprofloxacin was administered 2 hours prior to a marketed chewable/dispersible tablet formulation of VIDEX.
The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given ciprofloxacin and didanosine-placebo tablets concurrently.
In a single subject given one dose of ciprofloxacin 2 hours after a dose of didanosine-placebo tablets, a greater than 50% reduction in the AUC of ciprofloxacin was observed.
Plasma concentrations of quinolone antibiotics are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or aluminum.
The optimal dosing interval for coadministration with VIDEX should be determined by consulting the appropriate quinolone package insert.
Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of delavirdine (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with VIDEX.
To avoid this interaction, delavirdine or indinavir should be given 1 hour prior to dosing with VIDEX.
The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir are not altered to a clinically significant degree when it is administered with a light meal 1 hour after VIDEX.
Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
Antidiabetic drug requirements (i.e., insulin) may be altered.
conversely, diethylpropion may interfere with antihypertensive drugs (i.e., guanethidine, a-methyldopa).
Concurrent use of phenothiazines may antagonize the anorectic effect of diethylpropion.
May interact anticoagulants (altered hypo-prothrombinemic effect), barbiturates, rifampin and other inducers of hepatic microsomal enzyme oxidation system (decreased effect of diethylstilbestrol), corticosteroids (increased effect of corticosteroids).
Oral Anticoagulants: In some normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of diflunisal and warfarin, acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon resulted in prolongation of prothrombin time.
This may occur because diflunisal competitively displaces coumarins from protein binding sites.
Accordingly, when diflunisal is administered with oral anticoagulants, the prothrombin time should be closely monitored during and for several days after concomitant drug administration.
Tolbutamide: In diabetic patients receiving diflunisal and tolbutamide, no significant effects were seen on tolbutamide plasma levels or fasting blood glucose.
Hydrochlorothiazide: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide.
Diflunisal decreased the hyperuricemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide.
Furosemide: In normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of diflunisal and furosemide had no effect on the diuretic activity of furosemide.
Diflunisal decreased the hyperuricemic effect of furosemide.
Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids may reduce plasma levels of diflunisal.
This effect is small with occasional doses of antacids, but may be clinically significant when antacids are used on a continuous schedule.
Acetaminophen: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen.
Acetaminophen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal.
Since acetaminophen in high doses has been associated with hepatotoxicity, concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen should be used cautiously, with careful monitoring of patients.
Concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen in dogs, but not in rats, at approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human therapeutic dose of each (40 to 52 mg/kg/day of diflunisal/acetaminophen) resulted in greater gastrointestinal toxicity than when either drug was administered alone.
Methotrexate: Caution should be used if diflunisal is administered concomitantly with methotrexate.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of methotrexate and to potentiate its toxicity.
Cyclosporine: Administration of nonsteroial anti-inflammatory drugs concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The administration of diflunisal to normal volunteers receiving indomethacin decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin.
In some patients the combined use of indomethacin and diflunisal has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Therefore, indomethacin and diflunisal should not be used concomitantly.
The concomitant use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy.
Aspirin: In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when multiple doses of diflunisal and aspirin were administered concomitantly.
Sulindac: The concomitant administration of diflunisal and sulindac in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.
Naproxen: The concomitant administration of diflunisal and naproxen in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite.
Naproxen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal.
Potassium-depleting diuretics are a major contributing factor to digitalis toxicity.
Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum digoxin concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase digoxin absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
Propantheline and diphenoxylate, by decreasing gut motility, may increase digoxin absorption.
Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal digoxin absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
Rifampin may decrease serum digoxin concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
There have been inconsistent reports regarding the effects of other drugs (e.g., quinine, penicillamine) on serum digoxin concentration.
Thyroid administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of digoxin.
Concomitant use of digoxin and sympathomimetics increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
Although beta-adrenergic blockers or calcium channel blockers and digoxin may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
Furthermore, caution should be exercised when combining digoxin with any drug that may cause a significant deterioration in renal function, since a decline in glomerular filtration or tubular secretion may impair the excretion of digoxin.
Vasoconstrictors: D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used with peripheral vasoconstrictors because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
Sumatriptan: Sumatriptan has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.
Sumatriptan and D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
Beta Blockers: Although the results of a clinical study did not indicate a safe problem associated with the administration of D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP to subjects already receiving propranolol, there have been reports that propranolol may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine.
Nicotine: Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy.
Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the macrolide class, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of ergotamine-containing drugs when co-administered with these antibiotics.
SSRIs: Weakness hyperreflexia, and incoordination have been reported rarely when 5-HT1 agonists have been co-administered with SSRIs (e. g.
fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline).
There have been no reported cases from spontaneous reports of drug interaction between SSRIs and D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.
Oral Contraceptives: The effect of oral contraceptives on the pharmacokinetics of D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP has not been studied.
Administration of thiazide diuretics to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with dihydrotachysterol may cause hypercalcemia.
Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with Tiazac.
Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem hydrochloride and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated, but available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities.
Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem.
If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted.
A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and AUC (53%) after a 1-week course of cimetidine 1200 mg/day and a single dose of diltiazem 60mg.
The effect may be mediated by cimetidines known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem.
Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine.
Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride with digoxin in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%.
Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing diltiazem hydrochloride therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers.
When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium channel blockers should be titrated carefully.
A pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of cyclosporine dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of diltiazem.
If these agents are to be administered concurrently, cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.
The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not been evaluated.
Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases.
Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3-4 fold and the Cmax by 2-fold, compared to placebo.
The elimination half life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with diltiazem.
These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sodation)of both midazolam and triazolam.
In a ten-subject study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg bid) with lovastatin resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax vs. lovastatin alone;
no change in pravastatin AUC and Cmax was observed during diltiazem coadministration.
Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin.
Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
Coadministration of diltiazem with rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
Dimenhydrinate may decrease emetic response to apomorphine.
Oxytocin or other oxytocics (concurrent use with dinoprost may result in uterine hypertonus, possibly causing uterine rupture or cervical laceration, especially in the absence of adequate cervical dilatation;
PROSTIN E2 may augment the activity of other oxytocic drugs.
Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc).
MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.
anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity - anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with diphenidol;
apomorphine - prior ingestion of diphenidol may decrease the emetic response to apomorphine in the treatment of poisoning.
Known drug interactions include barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol.
Diphenoxylate HCl and atropine sulfate may interact with MAO inhibitors In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
This drug may interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with PERSANTINE  (dipyridamole USP) Tablets.
Adenosine: Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine.
Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
Terfenadine: In a prospective study involving six-healthy-male volunteers, dirithromycin did not affect the metabolism of terfenadine.
These six volunteers received terfenadine alone (60 mg twice daily) for 8 days, followed by terfenadine in combination with dirithromycin (500 mg once daily) for 10 days.
The pharmacokinetics of terfenadine and its acid metabolite and the electrocardiographic QT c interval were measured during both periods: with terfenadine alone, and with terfenadine plus dirithromycin.
in one man, the C max of terfenadine was 8.1 ng/mL with terfenadine alone and 7.2 ng/mL with terfenadine plus dirithromycin.
The mean QT c interval (msec) was 369 with terfenadine alone and 367 with terfenadine plus dirithromycin.
Also, in vitro experiments demonstrated a lack of interaction between dirithromycin and terfenadine.
Thus, the interaction observed between erythromycin and terfenadine is not expected for dirithromycin.
Serious cardiac dysrhythmias, some resulting in death, have occurred in patients receiving terfenadine concomitantly with other macrolide antibiotics.
In addition, most macrolides are contraindicated in patients receiving terfenadine therapy who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities (arrhythmia, bradycardia, QT c interval prolongation, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, etc.) or electrolyte disturbances.
Theophylline: Following co-administration of two 250-mg dirithromycin tablets administered once daily with 200-mg theophylline tablets administered twice daily for 10 days to 14 healthy subjects, the steady-state plasma concentration of theophylline was not significantly altered.
In general, most patients treated with dirithromycin who are receiving concomitant theophylline therapy may not require empiric adjustment of theophylline dosage or monitoring of theophylline plasma concentrations.
However, theophylline plasma concentrations should be monitored, with dosage adjustment as appropriate, in patients whose pulmonary disease requires maintaining a given theophylline plasma concentration for optimal pulmonary function or in patients with theophylline concentrations at the higher end of the therapeutic range.
Antacids or H 2 receptor antagonists: When dirithromycin is administered immediately following antacids or H 2 -receptor antagonists, the absorption of dirithromycin is slightly enhanced.
Triazolam: Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
Digoxin: Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
Anticoagulants: There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly.
Ergotamine: Concurrent use of erythromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of erythromycin and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
If phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or Norpace CR, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
Other antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, propranolol) have occasionally been used concurrently with Norpace.
In healthy subjects, no significant drug-drug interaction was observed when Norpace was coadministered with either propranolol or diazepam.
Concomitant administration of Norpace and quinidine resulted in slight increases in plasma disopyramide levels and slight decreases in plasma quinidine levels.
Norpace does not increase serum digoxin levels.
Patients taking disopyramide phosphate and erythromycin concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of disopyramide resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval.
Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration.
DISULFIRAM SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING PHENYTOIN AND ITS CONGENERS.
SINCE THE CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF THESE TWO DRUGS CAN LEAD TO PHENYTOIN INTOXICATION, PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING DISULFIRAM TO A PATIENT ON PHENYTOIN THERAPY, A BASELINE PHENYTOIN SERUM LEVEL SHOULD BE OBTAINED.
It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral anticoagulants upon beginning or stopping disulfiram. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
Patients taking isoniazid when disulfiram is given should be observed for the appearance of unsteady gait or marked changes in mental status;
In rats, simultaneous ingestion of disulfiram and nitrite in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that disulfiram may react with nitrites in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
Animal studies indicate that dobutamine may be ineffective if the patient has recently received a b-blocking drug.
Preliminary studies indicate that the concomitant use of dobutamine and nitroprusside results in a higher cardiac output and, usually, a lower pulmonary wedge pressure than when either drug is used alone.
There was no evidence of drug interactions in clinical studies in which dobutamine was administered concurrently with other drugs, including digitalis preparations, furosemide, spironolactone, lidocaine, glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, morphine, atropine, heparin, protamine, potassium chloride, folic acid, and acetaminophen.
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as cyclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, and troleandomycin.
Drug-Drug Interactions Cimetidine: Concomitant use of cimetidine is contraindicated.
Cimetidine at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with TIKOSYN (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
Cimetidine at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in dofetilide plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
If a patient requires TIKOSYN and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to cimetidine, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
Verapamil: Concomitant use of verapamil is contraindicated.
Co-administration of TIKOSYN with verapamil resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
In an analysis of the supraventricular arrhythmia and DIAMOND patient populations, the concomitant administration of verapamil with dofetilide was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
Ketoconazole: Concomitant use of ketoconazole is contraindicated.
Ketoconazole at 400 mg daily (the maximum approved prescription dose) co-administered with TIKOSYN (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide Cmax by 53% in males and 97% in females, and AUC by 41% in males and 69% in females.
Trimethoprim Alone or in Combination with Sulfamethoxazole: Concomitant use of trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated.
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Alone or in Combination with Triamterene: Concomitant use of HCTZ alone or in combination with triamterene is contraindicated.
HCTZ 50 mg QD or HCTZ/triamterene 50/100 mg QD was co-administered with TIKOSYN (500 mcg BID) for 5 days (following 2 days of diuretic use at half dose).
In patients receiving HCTZ alone, dofetilide AUC increased by 27% and Cmax by 21%.
In the DIAMOND trials, 1252 patients were treated with TIKOSYN and diuretics concomitantly of whom 493 died compared to 508 deaths among the 1248 patients receiving placebo and diuretics.
Of the 229 patients who had potassium depleting diuretics added to their concomitant medications in the DIAMOND trials, the patients on TIKOSYN had a non-significantly reduced relative risk for death of 0.68 (95% CI 0.376, 1.230).
In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase dofetilide levels.
Inhibitors of this isoenzyme (e.g., macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, amiodarone, cannabinoids, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, nefazadone, norfloxacin, quinine, zafirlukast) should be cautiously coadministered with TIKOSYN as they can potentially increase dofetilide levels.
Other Drug Interaction Information Digoxin: Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that TIKOSYN does not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
In patients, the concomitant administration of digoxin with dofetilide was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
It is not clear whether this represents an interaction with TIKOSYN or the presence of more severe structural heart disease in patients on digoxin;
Other Drugs: In healthy volunteers, amlodipine, phenytoin, glyburide, ranitidine, omeprazole, hormone replacement therapy (a combination of conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone), antacid (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) and theophylline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of TIKOSYN.
In addition, studies in healthy volunteers have shown that TIKOSYN does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin, or the pharmacokinetics of propranolol (40 mg twice daily), phenytoin, theophylline, or oral contraceptives.
Concomitant medications were grouped as ACE inhibitors, oral anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, cardiac glycosides, inducers of CYP3A4, substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4, substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, nitrates, sulphonylureas, loop diuretics, potassium sparing diuretics, thiazide diuretics, substrates and inhibitors of tubular organic cation transport, and QTc-prolonging drugs.
The mean clearances of dofetilide were 16% and 15% lower in patients on thiazide diuretics and inhibitors of tubular organic cation transport, respectively.
The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by dolasetron and hydrodolasetron appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy or surgery, because hydrodolasetron is eliminated by multiple routes.
Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when dolasetron was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
In patients taking furosemide, nifedipine, diltiazem, ACE inhibitors, verapamil, glyburide, propranolol, and various chemotherapy agents, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron.
Clearance of hydrodolasetron decreased by about 27% when dolasetron mesylate was administered intravenously concomitantly with atenolol.
Dolasetron mesylate did not inhibit the antitumor activity of four chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in four murine models.
Because dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), inhibition of this enzyme prolongs and potentiates the effect of dopamine.
Patients who have been treated with MAO inhibitors within two to three weeks prior to the administration of dopamine HCl should receive initial doses of dopamine HCl no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose.
Concurrent administration of low-dose dopamine HCl and diuretic agents may produce an additive or potentiating effect on urine flow.
Cardiac effects of dopamine are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol and metoprolol.
The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of dopamine HCl is antagonized by alpha-adrenergic blocking agents.
Dopamine-induced renal and mesenteric vasodilation is not antagonized by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocking agents.
Butyrophenones (such as haloperidol) and phenothiazines can suppress the dopaminergic renal and mesenteric vasodilation induced with low dose dopamine infusion.
Cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered catecholamines, such as dopamine.
Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering dopamine HCl to patients receiving cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.
It has been reported that results of studies in animals indicate that dopamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias during anesthesia can be reversed by propranolol.
The concomitant use of vasopressors, vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine) and some oxytocic drugs may result in severe hypertension.
Administration of phenytoin to patients receiving dopamine HCl has been reported to lead to hypotension and bradycardia.
It is suggested that in patients receiving dopamine HCl, alternatives to phenytoin should be used if anticonvulsant therapy is needed.
Clinical trials have indicated that Pulmozyme can be effectively and safely used in conjunction with standard cystic fibrosis therapies including oral, inhaled and/or parenteral antibiotics, bronchodilators, enzyme supplements, vitamins, oral or inhaled corticosteroids, and analgesics.
Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy).
Prior administration of succinylcholine has no clinically important effect on the neuromuscular blocking action of NUROMAX.
The use of NUROMAX before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied.
There are no clinical data on concomitant use of NUROMAX and other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
Isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane decrease the ED50 of NUROMAX by 30% to 45%.
Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as NUROMAX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by NUROMAX is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or carbamazepine.
Administration of doxapram to patients who are receiving sympathomimetic or monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs may result in an additive pressor effect .
In patients who have received muscle relaxants, doxapram may temporarily mask the residual effects of muscle relaxant drugs.
In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin.
Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p=0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin.
Analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin).
Antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin).
Antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine).
Cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol).
Sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam).
Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses.
cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide).
While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition.
The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other.
Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug.
It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.
Inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 (i.e., quinidine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) may increase the plasma concentration of doxepin when administered concomitantly.
MAO Inhibitors: Serious side effects and even death have been reported following the concomitant use of certain drugs with MAO inhibitors.
Therefore, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with SINEQUAN.
Cimetidine: Cimetidine has been reported to produce clinically significant fluctuations in steady-state serum concentrations of various tricyclic antidepressants.
Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, urinary retention and blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressant when cimetidine therapy is initiated.
Additionally, higher than expected tricyclic antidepressant levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking cimetidine.
In patients who have been reported to be well controlled on tricyclic antidepressants receiving concurrent cimetidine therapy, discontinuation of cimetidine has been reported to decrease established steady-state serum tricyclic antidepressant levels and compromise their therapeutic effects.
Alcohol: It should be borne in mind that alcohol ingestion may increase the danger inherent in any intentional or unintentional SINEQUAN overdosage.
Tolazamide: A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on tolazamide (1 gm/day) 11 days after the addition of doxepin (75 mg/day).
DOXIL  may interact with drugs known to interact with the conventional formulation of doxorubicin HCl.
Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.
Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
Absorption of tetracycline is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate.
Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.
The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.
Potential drug interactions for doxylamine include, increased sedation if doxylamine is combined with other CNS depressant drugs.
Antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of heparin or warfarin.
Doxylamine may enhance the effects of epinephrine.
Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and therefore, insulin requirements.
Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with INAPSINE.
Following the administration of INAPSINE, the dose of other CNS depressant drugs should be reduced.
However, since there is an increased risk of bleeding with Xigris, caution should be employed when Xigris is used with other drugs that affect hemostasis.
Approximately 2/3 of the patients in the Phase 3 study received either prophylactic low dose heparin (unfractionated heparin up to 15,000 units/day) or prophylactic doses of low molecular weight heparins as indicated in the prescribing information for the specific products.
Concomitant use of prophylactic low dose heparin did not appear to affect safety, however, its effects on the efficacy of Xigris have not been evaluated in an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial.
Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Because Xigris may affect the APTT assay, Xigris present in plasma samples may interfere with one-stage coagulation assays based on the APTT (such as factor VIII, IX, and XI assays).
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Duloxetine: Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for duloxetine metabolism.
Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of duloxetine with fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of duloxetine.
Inhibitors of CYP2D6: Because CYP2D6 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of duloxetine.
Paroxetine (20 mg QD) increased the concentration of duloxetine (40 mg QD) by about 60%, and greater degrees of inhibition are expected with higher doses of paroxetine.
Similar effects would be expected with other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, quinidine).
Potential for Duloxetine to Affect Other Drugs: Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2: In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce CYP1A2 activity, and it is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates.
When duloxetine was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
Therefore, co-administration of Duloxetine with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of the TCA may need to be reduced if a TCA is co-administered with Duloxetine.
Because of the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, Duloxetine and thioridazine should not be co-administered.
Duloxetine May Have a Clinically Important Interaction with the Following Other Drugs: Alcohol: When Duloxetine and ethanol were administered several hours apart so that peak concentrations of each would coincide, Duloxetine did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol.
In the Duloxetine clinical trials database, three Duloxetine-treated patients had liver injury as manifested by ALT and total bilirubin elevations, with evidence of obstruction.
However, co-administration of Duloxetine with aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids (51 mEq) or Duloxetine with famotidine, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40-mg oral dose.
It is unknown whether the concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors affects duloxetine absorption.
Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., theophylline), ephedrine, and other sympathomimetic bronchodilators has been reported.
Concurrent administration of dyphylline and probenecid, which competes for tubular secretion, has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of dyphylline .
Phospholine Iodide potentiates other cholinesterase inhibitors such as succinylcholine or organophosphate and carbamate insecticides.
Steroids enhance the renal toxicity of edetate calcium disodium in animals. 7 Edetate calcium disodium interferes with the action of zinc insulin preparations by chelating the zinc. 7
RAPTIVA should not be used with other immunosuppressive drugs.
Acellular, live and live-attenuated vaccines should not be administered during RAPTIVA treatment.
Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A4 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with SUSTIVA (efavirenz).
In vitro studies have demonstrated that efavirenz inhibits 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 isozymes in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations.
Drugs which induce CYP3A4 activity (eg, phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations.
Antihistamines: Benzodiazepines GI Motility Agents Anti-Migraine Antifungal
astemizole midazolam, triazolam cisapride ergot derivatives voriconazole
When coadministered with SUSTIVA in treatment-naive patients, the recommended dose of atazanavir is 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg and SUSTIVA 600 mg (all once daily).
Dosing recommendations for SUSTIVA and atazanavir in treatment-experienced patients have not been established.
In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving SUSTIVA and clarithromycin.
No dose adjustment of SUSTIVA is recommended when given with clarithromycin.
Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered.
Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with SUSTIVA.
The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with SUSTIVA, is not known.
Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to SUSTIVA.
When indinavir at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with SUSTIVA (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.
Lopinavir/ritonavir
A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with SUSTIVA.
Coadministration in HIV-infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal.
Plasma concentrations increased by SUSTIVA (efavirenz);
Because the potential interaction of efavirenz with oral contraceptives has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week.
Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when SUSTIVA is used in combination with ritonavir.
Should not be used as sole protease inhibitor in combination with SUSTIVA.
Anticoagulants: Warfarin
Anticonvulsants: Phenytoin Phenobarbital Carbamazepine
Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant and/or efavirenz plasma levels;
Antifungals: Itraconazole Ketoconazole
Drug interaction studies with SUSTIVA and these imidazole and triazole antifungals have not been conducted.
SUSTIVA has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of itraconazole and ketoconazole.
Anti-HIV protease inhibitors: Saquinavir/ritonavir combination
Expected to substantially decrease plasma levels of efavirenz;has not been studied in combination with SUSTIVA.
Other Drugs: Based on the results of drug interaction studies, no dosage adjustment is recommended when SUSTIVA (efavirenz) is given with the following: aluminum/magnesium hydroxide antacids, azithromycin, cetirizine, famotidine, fluconazole, lamivudine, lorazepam, nelfinavir, paroxetine, and zidovudine.
Specific drug interaction studies have not been performed with SUSTIVA and NRTIs other than lamivudine and zidovudine.
Clinically significant interactions would not be expected since the NRTIs are metabolized via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways.
The potential for drug interactions with EMTRIVA has been studied in combination with indinavir, stavudine, famciclovir, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
Hypotension: Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril or enalaprilat.
The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril or enalaprilat can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril or enalaprilat.
Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of enalapril and enalapril IV is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).
Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents: In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the co-administration of enalapril may result in a further deterioration of renal function.
In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving VASOTEC.
However, reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.
This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.
Other Cardiovascular Agents: Enalapril and enalapril IV have been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking agents, hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
Enalapril IV has been used concomitantly with digitalis without evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions.
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Enalapril and enalapril IV attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics.
Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium.
Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors.
It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly with lithium.
If the usual amounts of nondepolarizing relaxants are given, the time for recovery from neuromuscular blockade will be longer in the presence of Enflurane than when halothane or nitrous oxide with a balanced technique are used.
Antiretroviral Agents: No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication.
Bismuth: Bismuth subsalicylate, given concomitantly with enoxacin or 60 minutes following enoxacin administration, decreased enoxacin bioavailability by approximately 25%.
Thus, concomitant administration of enoxacin and bismuth subsalicylate should be avoided.
Caffeine: Enoxacin is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of methylxanthines.
In a multiple-dose study, enoxacin caused a dose-related increase in the mean elimination half-life of caffeine, thereby decreasing the clearance of caffeine by up to 80% and leading to a five-fold increase in the AUC and the half-life of caffeine.
Trough plasma enoxacin levels were also 20% higher when caffeine and enoxacin were administered concomitantly.
Caffeine-related adverse effects have occurred in patients consuming caffeine while on therapy with enoxacin.
Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with other members of the quinolone class.
Digoxin: Enoxacin may raise serum digoxin levels in some individuals.
If signs and symptoms suggestive of digoxin toxicity occur when enoxacin and digoxin are given concomitantly, physicians are advised to obtain serum digoxin levels and adjust digoxin doses appropriately.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents: Seizures have been reported in patients taking enoxacin concomitantly with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug fenbufen.
Sucralfate and antacids: Quinolones form chelates with metal cations.
Therefore, administration of quinolones with antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum;
or with multivitamins containing zinc may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue quinolone concentrations.
Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide reduce the oral absorption of enoxacin by 75%.
The oral bioavailability of enoxacin is reduced by 60% with coadministration of ranitidine.
Theophylline: Enoxacin is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of methylxanthines.
Enoxacin interferes with the metabolism of theophylline resulting in a 42% to 74% dose-related decrease in theophylline clearance and a subsequent 260% to 350% increase in serum theophylline levels.
Theophylline-related adverse effects have occurred in patients when theophylline and enoxacin were coadministered.
Warfarin: Quinolones, including enoxacin, decrease the clearance of R-warfarin, the less active isomer of racemic warfarin.
Enoxacin does not affect the clearance of the active S-isomer, and changes in clotting time have not been observed when enoxacin and warfarin were coadministered.
Nevertheless, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be monitored when warfarin or its derivatives and enoxacin are given concomitantly.
These agents include medications such as: anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid, sali-cylates, NSAIDs (including ketorolac tromethamine), dipyridamole, or sulfinpyrazone.
In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between entacapone and other highly bound drugs, such as warfarin, salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, and diazepam.
Treatment with entacapone coadministered with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor does not change these effects.
No interaction was noted with the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline in two multiple-dose interaction studies when entacapone was coadministered with a levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (n=29).
More than 600 Parkinsons disease patients in clinical trials have used selegiline in combination with entacapone and levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor.
As most entacapone excretion is via the bile, caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion, glucuronidation, and intestinal beta-glucuronidase are given concurrently with entacapone.
These include probenecid, cholestyramine, and some antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, rifamipicin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol).
No interaction with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine was shown in a single-dose study with entacapone without coadministered levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.
Since entecavir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of BARACLUDE with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either entecavir or the coadministered drug.
Coadministration of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil,or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in significant drug interactions.
The effects of coadministration of BARACLUDE with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated, and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when BARACLUDE is coadministered with such drugs.
All vasopressors should be used cautiously in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
Epinephrine should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as isoproterenol) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
Administration of epinephrine to patients receiving cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as halothane which sensitize the myocardium, may induce cardiac arrhythmia..
Epinephrine also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis, glycosides) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
Diuretic agents may decrease vascular response to pressor drugs such as epinephrine.
Epinephrine may antagonize the neuron blockade produced by guanethidine resulting in decreased antihypertensive effect and requiring increased dosage of the latter.
Concomitant use of ELLENCE with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., calcium channel blockers), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.
Cimetidine increased the AUC of epirubicin by 50%.
Cimetidine treatment should be stopped during treatment with ELLENCE.
A pharmacokinetic study evaluating the administration of a single dose of INSPRA 100 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg BID, a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 pathway, showed a 1.7-fold increase in Cmax of eplerenone and a 5.4-fold increase in AUC of eplerenone.
Administration of eplerenone with other CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin 500 mg BID, verapamil 240 mg QD, saquinavir 1200 mg TID, fluconazole 200 mg QD) resulted in increases in Cmax of eplerenone ranging from 1.4- to 1.6- fold and AUC from 2.0- to 2.9- fold.
ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Congestive Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction)- In EPHESUS, 3020 (91%) patients receiving INSPRA 25 to 50 mg also received ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ACEI/ARB).
Rates of patients with maximum potassium levels  5.5 mEq/L were similar regardless of the use of ACEI/ARB.
ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of INSPRA 50 to 100 mg to ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).
In a study in diabetics with microalbuminuria INSPRA 200 mg combined with the ACE inhibitor enalapril 10 mg increased the frequency of hyperkalemia (serum potassium  5.5 mEq/L) from 17% on enalapril alone to 38%.
Lithium-A drug interaction study of eplerenone with lithium has not been conducted.
Serum lithium levels should be monitored frequently if INSPRA is administered concomitantly with lithium.
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)-A drug interaction study of eplerenone with an NSAID has not been conducted.
The administration of other potassium-sparing antihypertensives with NSAIDs has been shown to reduce the antihypertensive effect in some patients and result in severe hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function.
Therefore, when INSPRA and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, patients should be observed to determine whether the desired effect on blood pressure is obtained.
Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when FLOLAN is administered with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators.
When other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for FLOLAN to increase the risk of bleeding.
However, patients receiving infusions of FLOLAN in clinical trials were maintained on anticoagulants without evidence of increased bleeding.
In clinical trials, FLOLAN was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or digoxin in whom therapy with FLOLAN was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
However, patients on digoxin may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with FLOLAN, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
Eprosartan has been shown to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and the pharmacodynamics of warfarin and glyburide.
Because eprosartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, inhibitors of CYP450 enzyme would not be expected to affect its metabolism, and ketoconazole and fluconazole, potent inhibitors of CYP3A and 2C9, respectively, have been shown to have no effect on eprosartan pharmacokinetics.
Ranitidine also has no effect on eprosartan pharmacokinetics.
Eprosartan (up to 400 mg b.i.d. or 800 mg q.d.) doses have been safely used concomitantly with a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide).
Eprosartan doses of up to 300 mg b.i.d. have been safely used concomitantly with sustained-release calcium channel blockers (sustained-release nifedipine) with no clinically significant adverse interactions.
Enoxaparin dosed as a 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneous injection q12h for four doses did not alter the pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide or the level of platelet aggregation in healthy adults.
Mineral oil interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D preparations.
Administration of thiazide diuretics to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with ergocalciferol may cause hypercalcemia.
The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by triacetyloleandomycin which inhibits the metabolism of ergotamine.
The pressor effects of ERGOMAR and other vasoconstrictor drugs can combine to cause dangerous hypertension.
Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increases erlotinib AUC by 2/3.
Caution should be used when administering or taking TARCEVA with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin decreased erlotinib AUC by about 2/3.
If the TARCEVA dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of rifampicin or other inducers.
Other CYP3A4 inducers include, but are not limited to, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. Johns Wort.
Patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR
When ertapenem is co-administered with probenecid (500 mg p.o. every 6 hours), probenecid competes for active tubular secretion and reduces the renal clearance of ertapenem.
Based on total ertapenem concentrations, probenecid increased the AUC by 25% and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20% and 35%, respectively.
Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with probenecid to extend the half-life of ertapenem is not recommended.
In vitro studies indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin or vinblastine and that ertapenem is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.
Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity.
In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy.
Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly.
Concurrent use of erythromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
There have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with carbamazepine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, hexobarbital, phenytoin, alfentanil, cisapride, disopyramide, lovastatin, bromocriptine, valproate, terfenadine, and astemizole.
Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly.
In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.
There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin is coadministered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin.
Patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should be carefully monitored;
Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of alcohol by patients taking LEXAPRO is not recommended.
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)
Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.)
Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin potentiated the risk of bleeding.
Cimetidine - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg/day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and Cmax of 43% and 39%, respectively.
Digoxin - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.
Lithium - Coadministration of racemic citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.
Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in accordance with standard clinical practice.
Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when LEXAPRO and lithium are coadministered.
Pimozide and Celexa - In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone.
Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide.
Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and sumatriptan.
If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
Theophylline - Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline.
The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.
Warfarin - Administration of 40 mg/day racemic citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate.
Carbamazepine - Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate.
Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of escitalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
Triazolam - Combined administration of racemic citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.
Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.
Ritonavir - Combined administration of a single dose of ritonavir (600 mg), both a CYP3A4 substrate and a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and escitalopram (20 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either ritonavir or escitalopram.
However, coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg) and ritonavir (600 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram.
Because escitalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease escitalopram clearance.
In addition, steady state levels of racemic citalopram were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram, suggesting that coadministration, with escitalopram, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on escitalopram metabolism.
However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
Metoprolol - Administration of 20 mg/day LEXAPRO for 21 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 50% increase in Cmax and 82% increase in AUC of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol (given in a single dose of 100 mg).
Coadministration of LEXAPRO and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.
Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
Catecholamine-depleting drugs, e.g., reserpine, may have an additive effect when given with beta blocking agents.
Patients treated concurrently with BREVIBLOC (esmolol HCl) and a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
A study of interaction between BREVIBLOC and warfarin showed that concomitant administration of BREVIBLOC and warfarin does not alter warfarin plasma levels.
BREVIBLOC concentrations were equivocally higher when given with warfarin, but this is not likely to be clinically important.
When digoxin and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered intravenously to normal volunteers, there was a 10-20% increase in digoxin blood levels at some time points.
Digoxin did not affect BREVIBLOC pharmacokinetics.
When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but BREVIBLOC steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of morphine.
The effect of BREVIBLOC on the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade was studied in patients undergoing surgery.
The onset of neuromuscular blockade by succinylcholine was unaffected by BREVIBLOC, but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes.
Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, BREVIBLOC should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
Caution should be exercised when considering the use of BREVIBLOC and verapamil in patients with depressed myocardial function.
Additionally, BREVIBLOC should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
Drug interaction studies have shown that esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.
Post-marketing reports of changes in prothrombin measures have been received among patients on concomitant warfarin and esomeprazole therapy.
Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.
Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme.
Coadministration of esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.
Therefore, esomeprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).
Coadministration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine did not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of esomeprazole.
Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with pimozide is contraindicated.
The action of the benzodiazepines may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between estazolam and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
Estazolam: Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A): The metabolism of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam and the metabolism of other triazolobenzodiazepines is catalyzed by CYP3A.
Consequently, estazolam should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
Drug Interaction with Fluoxetine: A multiple-dose study was conducted to assess the effect of fluoxetine 20 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of estazolam 2 mg QHS after seven days.
The pharmacokinetics of estazolam (Cmax and AUC) were not affected during multiple-dose fluoxetine, suggesting no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction.
Estazolam: Interaction with Other Drugs that are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP): At clinically relevant concentrations, in vitro studies indicate that estazolam (0.6 M) was not inhibitory towards the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A.
Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively.
Milk, milk products, and calcium-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of EMCYT.
CNS-Active Drugs Ethanol An additive effect on psychomotor performance was seen with coadministration of eszopiclone and ethanol 0.70 g/kg for up to 4 hours after ethanol administration.
Paroxetine: Coadministration of single doses of eszopiclone 3 mg and paroxetine 20 mg daily for 7 days produced no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction.
Lorazepam: Coadministration of single doses of eszopiclone 3 mg and lorazepam 2 mg did not have clinically relevant effects on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of either drug.
Olanzapine: Coadministration of eszopiclone 3 mg and olanzapine 10 mg produced a decrease in DSST scores.
Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 (Ketoconazole) CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone.
The AUC of eszopiclone was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days.
Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly.
Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 (Rifampicin) Racemic zopiclone exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant useof rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4.
Drugs With A Narrow Therapeutic Index Digoxin A single dose of eszopiclone 3 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin measured at steady state following dosing of 0.5 mg twice daily for one day and 0.25 mg daily for the next 6 days.
Warfarin: Eszopiclone 3 mg administered daily for 5 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of (R)- or (S)-warfarin, nor were there any changes in the pharmacodynamic profile (prothrombin time) following a single 25 mg oral dose of warfarin
However, it was observed that the pharmacokinetics of ENBREL  was unaltered by concomitant methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent ENBREL  and anakinra therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with ENBREL  alone (0%).
Two percent of patients treated concurrently with ENBREL  and anakinra developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L).
Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with sulfasalazine, to which ENBREL was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either ENBREL CI or sulfasalazine alone.
Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
EDECRIN may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein;
In some patients, the administration of a non- steroidal antiinflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium- sparing and thiazide diuretics.
Therefore, when EDECRIN and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
The results of a study of coadministration of ethambutol (50 mg/kg) with an aluminum hydroxide containing antacid to 13 patients with tuberculosis showed a reduction of mean serum concentrations and urinary excretion of ethambutol of approximately 20% and 13%, respectively, suggesting that the oral absorption of ethambutol may be reduced by these antacid products.
It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of ethambutol with aluminum hydroxide containing antacids for at least 4 hours following ethambutol administration.
Dicumarol and warfarin may decrease hypoprothrombinemic effect.
Other depressasnts such as alcohol, barbiturates, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with ethchlorvynol.
May interact with addictive medications, especially central nervous system (CNS) depressants with habituating potential (prolonged concurrent use may increase the risk of habituation), alcohol or CNS depression producing medications (concurrent use may increase the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or ethinamate).
Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
Trecator has been found to temporarily raise serum concentrations of isoniazid.
Trecator may potentiate the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs administered concomitantly.
In particular, convulsions have been reported when ethionamide is administered with cycloserine and special care should be taken when the treatment regimen includes both of these drugs.
Ethopropazine may interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants, causing increased sedative effects.
It may also interact with amantadine or other anticholinergic drugs or MAOIs, which may intensify the anticholinergic action.
Ethopropazine can interact with chlorpromazine, increasing the metabolism of chlorpromazine.
Since Zarontin (ethosuximide) may interact with concurrently administered antiepileptic drugs, periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (eg, ethosuximide may elevate phenytoin serum levels and valproic acid has been reported to both increase and decrease ethosuximide levels).
Considerable caution should be exercised if PEGANONE is administered concurrently with Phenurone (phenacemide) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
A two-way interaction between the hydantoin antiepileptic, phenytoin, and the coumarin anticoagulants has been suggested.
Presumably, phenytoin acts as a stimulator of coumarin metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the coumarin anticoagulants and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
Conversely, the coumarin anticoagulants have been reported to increase the serum levels and prolong the serum half-life of phenytoin by inhibiting its metabolism.
Although there is no documentation of such, a similar interaction between ethotoin and the coumarin anticoagulants may occur.
Caution is therefore advised when administering PEGANONE to patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants.
